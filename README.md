ASX price sensitive announcement analysis

This project aims to download price sensitive announcements released on the ASX  in real time using web scraping in python. Then save them as txt files and identify the announcements most likely to benefit the company's share price greatly.

I used a shell script because I was learning that language at uni at the time and thought it might be fun to use in a side project.
