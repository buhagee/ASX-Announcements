St Barbara Limited (ASX:SBM) (the “Company”) provides the following production update for the June 2020
quarter (Q4 FY20) and full year FY20.

FY20 consolidated gold production was 381,887 ounces, in line with full year production guidance of 370,000
to 400,000 ounces. Consolidated production for Q4 FY20 was 108,612 ounces (Q3 FY20: 91,547 ounces). This
is the first time St Barbara has produced more than 100,000 ounces in a quarter since Q4 June FY18.

Atlantic Gold finished the full year with a record 106,663 ounces of gold, producing 29,209 ounces at an
average milled grade of 1.41 g/t Au for a record quarter. Higher than forecast mill throughput and recovery
during the quarter contributed to the record production performance for FY20.
Gwalia produced 171,156 ounces of gold for the full year, with 51,297 ounces produced in the quarter. Mill
throughput for the quarter was the highest since 2014, with 244 kt of ore milled at an average grade of
6.8 g/t Au. The improved production performance follows the implementation of improvements to processes
and procedures following an operational review with external consultants. Ore mined was prioritised during
the quarter over the completion of the final raise bore ventilation shaft. The final raise bore ventilation shaft
is currently at 473 metres (92% complete), and is due for completion by the end of July 2020.

Simberi delivered 104,068 ounces of gold for the full year, with 28,106 ounces produced at an average milled
grade of 1.31 g/t Au for the quarter. Grade was higher than anticipated due to some higher grade zones
mined in Botlu and Sorowar central pits. Availability of the rope conveyor affected production, with the
replacement of a 250 metre section of belt during the quarter. The remainder of the original rope conveyor
belt (1,200 metres) is scheduled to be replaced during FY21. Plant feed during the quarter was
supplemented from lower grade stockpiles.
Total cash at bank and term deposits was A$406 million at 30 June 2020 (31 March 2020: A$320 million), with
total debt of A$316 million (31 March 2020: A$316 million).
Further commentary on operations will be provided in the Q4 June FY20 quarterly report scheduled to be
released on 29 July 2020, including production costs, cash flow details, FY21 guidance and an update on the
Company’s growth projects.

St Barbara Managing Director and CEO, Craig Jetson, said, “The June quarter performance highlights the
extraordinary efforts of our people and business partners in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. We
continue to adhere to our COVID‐19 management plan to care for our people and our partners, safely maintain
our operations and manage this ongoing risk.

For personal use only

I was pleased to have the opportunity to spend a week at our Leonora Operations during June, my first visit
there due to the travel restrictions imposed by COVID‐19. This gave me a first‐hand view of the end‐to‐end
value chain and time on the ground with the team, which was invaluable as we look to the year ahead.

This quarter reflects our strong focus on Gwalia’s production profile, the positive impact of the Atlantic Gold
operations and the opportunity that remains at Simberi. We are working hard to deliver on our current assets
as we review our business and operating model to ensure an exciting future for St Barbara. 2020 marks a new
era in the evolution of St Barbara.”
