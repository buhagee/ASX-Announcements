Metro achieved a record shipping month in June with a total of 536,454WMT loaded onto Ocean Going
Vessels. Combined with the strong performances in April and May, Metro has exceeded the upper end
of June quarter guidance by 150,688WMT (14%). Mining rates remained high, but were kept below
shipping rates in order to reduce stockpiles to a level easier to manage.
Metro Mining Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Simon Finnis, said:
“We have exceeded expectations throughout the entire June quarter, demonstrating that this
level of production is sustainable. I must again congratulate all our operational teams, contract
partners and all staff who have performed unbelievably well under the difficult circumstances
we’re all experiencing as a result of COVID-19. “
