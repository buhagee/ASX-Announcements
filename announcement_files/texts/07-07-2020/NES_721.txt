ABOUT NELSON RESOURCES
Nelson Resources is an exploration company with a highly prospective 956km² tenure holding.
The key focus for the company is its 828 km² Woodline Project.
The Woodline Project lies on the boundary of the Albany Fraser Oregon and the Norseman Wiluna Greenstone belt in Western Australia.
The Woodline Project contains:
•

45km of the Cundeelee Shear Zone which already consists of a known +20km gold
geochemical and bedrock anomaly, hosted in the same geological structural setting ¹ as
the 7.7 million ounce Tropicana Gold mine ².

•

30km of significantly unexplored greenstones along the Norseman-Wiluna greenstone
belt.

•

A significant and unique holding within the confluence of the Keith-Kilkenny Fault / the
Claypan Shear Zone and the Cundeelee Shear Zone. These three Shears have hosted
many of the largest gold projects in Western Australia.

•

Historical exploration of $14 million by the Company, Sipa Resources, Newmont and
MRG.

The 7.7 million ounce Tropicana Gold Mine which is operated by AngloGold Ashanti was
discovered in 2005 by IGO Group Limited via a gold-in-soil anomaly that led to further exploration
and is one of the most important gold discoveries in Australia for decades. Tropicana currently
produces approximately 450,000 ounces per annum ³. In today’s gold price terms, that equates
to over A$1 billion dollars per annum.
Nelson Resources confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially
affects the exploration results included in this announcement.
