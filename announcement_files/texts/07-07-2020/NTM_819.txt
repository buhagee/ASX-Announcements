Historic exploration at Redcliffe has
been limited to shallow depths
(predominantly less than 50m)

•

Large areas remain untested

•

As evidenced by the Hub discovery,
significant potential remains to
discover meaningful orebodies near

1. Totals may differ due to rounding, Mineral Resource estimates reported on a dry in‐situ basis.
2. The Statement of Mineral Resource estimates has been compiled by Mr Andrew Bewsher who is a full‐time employee of BMGS and a Member of the AIG. Mr Bewsher has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style
of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity that he has undertaken to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the JORC Code (2012).

3. Hub Mineral Resource estimate figures reported in the tables above represent estimates at 5th May 2020. Mineral Resource estimates are not precise calculations, being dependent on the interpretation of limited
information on the location, shape and continuity of the occurrence and on the available sampling results. The totals contained in the above table have been rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimate.
4. Mineral Resource Estimates are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (The Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code – JORC2012 Edition).

Wells Group Acquisition
•

Large area of 426km2

•

More than doubles NTM’s land position to +720km2

•

Very prospective, however, very little historic exploration

•

Contains northern extent of Mertondale Shear Zone

•

Crosscut by multiple regional structures

•

Early stage greenfield’s opportunity

•

At least 24 targets identified from preliminary review

•

Initial groundwork commenced and approvals being sought

Targets

15

For personal use only

Strategic Value
•

NTM’s strategy is to build economic gold Resources via
exploration at Redcliffe

•

Increasing Resource scale will enhance value and scope
for project monetisation

•

Significantly, there are four processing plants in the
region providing:
– Potential demand for more (oxide) ore
– Regional consolidation opportunities or development
synergies

•

NTM has a near surface high-grade oxide gold
mineralisation which represents a valuable asset for the
Company

•

Leonora is an outstanding region in which to explore and
develop gold operations

16

For personal use only

2020 Focus
• Drilling
– Most of the year will be spent drilling
– Large aircore program underway
• Mertondale Shear Zone targets
• Wells Group

– RC & Diamond follow up at Hub, GTS & other Prospects

• Company is well funded with $7m in cash

– Prepared by Dr James Lally
Low

14.38 Mt @ 1.8g/t for 0.84Moz

High

21.55 Mt @ 2.5g/t for 1.70Moz

Excludes current resource of:
13.42 Mt @ 1.6g/t for 0.68Moz2

• Three categories
– Extension of known Mineral Resources
– Prospect potential with limited drilling to date
– Prospect potential with no or sparse drilling to date

1: See ASX Announcement 4th June 2019
2: See Appendix I for Resource Statement

Note: The upper and lower grades of the Exploration Target
estimate do not necessarily correspond to the upper and lower
tonnages
Exploration Target Cautionary Statement: The potential quantity
and grade of this Exploration Target is conceptual in nature.
There has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral
Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in
the estimation of a Mineral Resource.
