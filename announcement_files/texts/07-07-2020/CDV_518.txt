CARDINAL ISSUES SHARES TO SHANDONG GOLD
Cardinal Resources Limited (ASX/TSX: CDV) (“Cardinal” or “Company”) announces that further to the press
release and the Bid Implementation Agreement dated 18 June 2020, Cardinal has now raised A$11,960,000
as a result of the issue of 26,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares (“Placement”) to Shandong Gold Mining
(HongKong) Co., Ltd (a subsidiary of Shandong Gold Mining Co., Ltd.) (“Shandong Gold”) in accordance with
the terms of the Bid Implementation Agreement.
Shandong Gold has agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares in Cardinal at a
price of A$0.60 cash per share, by way of an off‐market takeover offer (“Offer”). The proposed off‐market
takeover offer requires a number of conditions to be met, including a 50.1% minimum acceptance condition.
Shareholder approval is not required for this Placement as the Company is issuing the shares under its Listing
Rule 7.1 placement capacity.
The funds raised by this Placement will be used to ensure Cardinal may continue advancing the Namdini
Project towards development and for working capital.

Timetable and Next Steps
Detailed information relating to the Shandong Gold Offer, will be set out in the Bidder’s Statement and
Target’s Statement, which are currently expected to be dispatched to Cardinal shareholders on or about 22
July 2020.
The Bidder’s Statement and Target’s Statement will set out important information, including how to accept
the Shandong Gold Offer, information about Shandong Gold and the key reasons why Cardinal Shareholders
should accept the Shandong Gold Offer in the absence of a superior proposal.

Corporate Update
As contemplated in the announcement dated 18 June 2020, the completion of the Placement was subject to
and conditional upon no competing proposal being received by Cardinal within 14 days from entering into
the BIA (Protection Period) which the Cardinal Board of Directors consider to be superior to the Shandong
Gold Offer (Superior Proposal). No such Superior Proposal emerged during the Protection Period or as at
the date of this announcement from any party. Accordingly, the Company cautions any trading on speculation
that another formal proposal capable of acceptance or Superior Proposal will arise.

About Shandong Gold

metals. Shandong Gold is listed on the main board of both the Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges.
Shandong Gold had a market capitalisation of approximately US$14.5 billion as at 18 June 2020. In 2019,

Disclaimer
This ASX / TSX press release has been prepared by Cardinal Resources Limited (ABN: 56 147 325 620) (“Cardinal” or “the
Company”). Neither the ASX or the TSX, nor their regulation service providers accept responsibility for the adequacy or

at the date of this press release. The information in this press release is of a general nature and does not purport to be
complete nor does it contain all the information, which a prospective investor may require in evaluating a possible
investment in Cardinal.
By its very nature exploration for minerals is a high‐risk business and is not suitable for certain investors. Cardinal’s
securities are speculative. Potential investors should consult their stockbroker or financial advisor. There are a number
of risks, both specific to Cardinal and of a general nature which may affect the future operating and financial
performance of Cardinal and the value of an investment in Cardinal including but not limited to economic conditions,
stock market fluctuations, gold price movements, regional infrastructure constraints, timing of approvals from relevant
authorities, regulatory risks, operational risks and reliance on key personnel and foreign currency fluctuations.
Except for statutory liability which cannot be excluded and subject to applicable law, each of Cardinal’s officers,
employees and advisors expressly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the material contained
in this press release and excludes all liability whatsoever (including in negligence) for any loss or damage which may be
suffered by any person as a consequence of any information in this Announcement or any error or omission here from.
Except as required by applicable law, the Company is under no obligation to update any person regarding any
inaccuracy, omission or change in information in this press release or any other information made available to a person
nor any obligation to furnish the person with any further information. Recipients of this press release should make their
own independent assessment and determination as to the Company’s prospects, its business, assets and liabilities as
well as the matters covered in this press release.
Forward‐looking statements
Certain statements contained in this press release, including information as to the future financial or operating
performance of Cardinal and its projects may also include statements which are ‘forward‐looking statements’ that may
include, amongst other things, statements regarding targets, estimates and assumptions in respect of mineral resources
and anticipated grades and recovery rates, production and prices, recovery costs and results, capital expenditures and
are or may be based on assumptions and estimates related to future technical, economic, market, political, social and
other conditions. These ‘forward – looking statements’ are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and
assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Cardinal, are inherently subject to significant technical, business,
economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies and involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from estimated or anticipated events or results
reflected in such forward‐looking statements.
Cardinal disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to any forward‐looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, circumstances or results or otherwise after today’s date or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than required by the Corporations Act and ASX and TSX Listing
Rules. The words ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘anticipate’, ‘indicate’, ‘contemplate’, ‘target’, ‘plan’, ‘intends’, ‘continue’, ‘budget’,
‘estimate’, ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘schedule’ and similar expressions identify forward‐looking statements.
All forward‐looking statements made in this press release are qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements.
Investors are cautioned that forward‐looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly
investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward‐looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty
therein.
