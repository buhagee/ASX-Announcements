Mozambique Operations – Palma

For personal use only

RBR’s Wentworth training and operations base’s refurbishment is reaching finalisation. Security has
been upgraded, connection to grid electricity restored, and new water reticulation and sewerage
connections installed. The buildings are being repurposed to the Company’s needs, and all the requisite
office and training equipment is in place or awaiting delivery.
The refurbishment and upgrade activities have been undertaken by RBR on behalf of the Wentworth
leaseholder, including using local workers hired, trained and supervised by the Company.
Although the JOBA Construction Skills Internship Program has started, the contractual work to date has
been completing the agreed upgrades to the Wentworth camp (co-funded under the contract). The
Company has commenced the recruitment of interns, who are graduates of the Total-sponsored Catalisa
work readiness program, from the stakeholder communities. The training of the interns is due to start
mid-July and the Company’s revenues will reflect this activity accordingly.

COVID-19 Status: Mozambique

For personal use only

The country has been only modestly impacted by COVID-19 to date. As at 6 July 2020, there were a
total of 987 cases, of which 723 were active, and 8 deaths. The initial outbreak was on the Afungi
peninsula where the LNG projects are being developed. Total, the lead developer of the c.US$23b
Mozambique LNG onshore project, has declared the site to be free of infection and there is cautious
optimism that improvements in hygiene and the implementation of transmission prevention measures will
keep this region free of infection. Contractors are returning to the LNG construction site camps and
resuming their activities.
Mozambique government departments have resumed partial operations, which in turn allows RBR’s
Futuro Business Services (FBS) to recommence its activities in processing various permits for clients. A
portion of FBS’s services involve visa and work permit processing which will recover in tandem with
expatriates returning to the country, and a resumption in international travel.
Mozambique will authorise international flights with selected countries and on a reciprocal basis,
intending to respond to the need for specialists, managers, and investors to boost tourism and business.

Status of LNG Projects and Market Opportunities
The Eni and Total-led consortia developing their two LNG projects intend to maintain their schedules.
Total recently reaffirmed its commitment to deliver first gas from its project in 2024.
Total’s Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor CCS JV is preparing quarantine sites in
Palma so that any people who become infected with COVID-19 or another contagious disease, can be
quarantined without hindering activities at site. One positive consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic
will be a greater reliance on local upskilling and employment in place of expatriate workers, which is
aligned with RBR’s business model.
The UK Government has agreed up to US$1bn in financing for a gas pipeline in Mozambique. The loan
guarantee is one of the biggest single fossil fuel investments made by the export credit agency UK Export
Finance (UKEF). RBR’s training subsidiary Futuro Skills Mozambique, as a provider of UK-accredited
training (Engineering Construction Industry Training Board - ECITB) is well-placed to secure a slice of
the local training that will be needed to execute this capital project.
