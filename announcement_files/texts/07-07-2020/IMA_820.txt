IMAGE RESOURCES SECURES SALES AGREEMENT
FOR 100,000 TONNES HMC
Image Resources NL (ASX: IMA) (“Image” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise it has
secured a sales agreement from its off-take partners for 100,000 tonnes of HMC from
current inventory at its high-grade, zircon-rich Boonanarring Mineral Sands Project located
80km north of Perth.
This sales agreement is with off-take partner Shantou Natfort Zirconium and Titanium Co., Ltd,
(“Natfort”) and Guangdong Orient Zirconic Ind Sci & Tech Co., Ltd, (“OZC”), to take delivery
of the 100kt of heavy mineral concentrate (“HMC”) across a 3 to 5 month period starting in
July 2020. Deliveries will be in multiple shipments of 20 to 30k tonnes each, and secured by
letters of credit.
Pricing is based on current market prices and will be locked for the full 100,000 tonnes to
protect against any unanticipated softening of the market during the delivery period.
In addition to this sale to Natfort and OZC, Image is proactively seeking to diversify its sales
base through the sale of HMC to interested buyers outside of the existing off-take
agreements. Discussions are ongoing with several other potential buyers and the Company
is confident the combination of sales to Natfort and OZC under the above sales agreement,
and potential sales to others will serve to monetise Image’s current surplus HMC inventory
across the next 3-4 months, and maintain more timely sales of ongoing production.
Managing Director and CEO Patrick Mutz stated, “Once again our off-take partners have
demonstrated their commitment to acquiring Image’s HMC by stepping up to purchase Image’s
surplus inventory even under the current uncertain economic conditions. This is a great
example of the benefits of a positive working relationship. We welcome the support, however
we also look forward to expanding our sales network beyond our current off-take agreements,
including, if achievable, broadening our customer base geographically.”
Background
Natfort has been the primary off-taker of Image’s HMC since the initial sale of product from
production at Boonanarring in January 2019. However, due to the negative economic impacts
and market uncertainties following the variety of restrictions implemented globally to control
the spread of COVID-19, demand for HMC, zircon and ilmenite softened in 1H 2020. On the
other hand, production at Boonanarring was largely unaffected by the restrictions and Image’s
HMC inventory increased to record levels of over 100kt at the end of May 2020. This 100kt
sales agreement from Natfort and OZC will address the delay in sales in 1H 2020 and provide
greater certainty for Image to meet its CY2020 sales guidance.
June Sales Up
Image completed the sale of two shipments of HMC in June 2020 for a total of approximately
30kt. Both were delivered to Natfort. The first was for a nominal 20kt and sailed on 15 June
and the second for a nominal 10kt and sailed on 28 June. As with all sales to-date, both
shipments were secured by an LC. Cash from the second shipment in June will be received in
July. Total sales for the June quarter were 64kt.
