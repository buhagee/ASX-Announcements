Successful Completion of EM Survey on Toro’s Yandal
Gold Project
•

THE GROUND BASED MOVING LOOP ELECTROMAGNETIC (MLEM) SURVEY BEING
CONDUCTED ON TORO’S YANDAL GOLD PROJECT HAS CONCLUDED.

•

THE SURVEY COVERED THE DUSTY NICKEL-GOLD PROSPECT, THE YANDAL ONE
NICKEL PROSPECT AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE GOLDEN WAYS TARGET
AREA.

•

THE SURVEY FIELD CREW HAS DEMOBILISED AND DATA ANALYSIS IS NOW UNDERWAY.

Toro Energy Limited (ASX: TOE) (‘the Company’ or ‘Toro’) is pleased to announce that the ground based
moving loop electromagnetic (‘MLEM’) geophysical survey being conducted on the Company’s 100%
owned Yandal Gold Project (‘the Project’) has successfully concluded. The Yandal Gold Project is located
in the Yandal Greenstone Belt, some 50km east of the world class Mt Keith nickel deposit (Figure 1) and
15km NE of the world class Bronzewing Gold Mine.
The aim of the ground based MLEM survey was to test for EM conductors beneath the surface that may
relate to massive concentrations of sulphides conducted. It was conducted over three main areas, the
Dusty Nickel-Gold Prospect, the Yandal One Nickel Prospect and a significant portion of the Golden Ways
Target Area (refer to Figure 2).

At Dusty, the survey concentrated on a northerly striking elongate magnetic anomaly thought to represent
the extension of the nickel hosting Dusty komatiite unit (refer to Figure 3 and the Company’s ASX
announcement of 10 June 2020). At Yandal One, the survey targeted the base of the komatiite in the
southern area of the 2016 reverse circulation (RC) drilling where the more favourable geochemistry was
intersected in that drilling and where the komatiite has been affected by faulting (refer to Figure 4 and the
Company’s ASX announcement of 18 June 2020). At Golden Ways, the survey was originally focused
over RC drill holes TERC09 and TERC11 but was expanded to include a large proportion of the target
area (refer to Figure 5 and the Company’s ASX announcements of 25 June 2020 and 2 July 2020).
The field crew has now demobilised from site and the data is with the consulting geophysicists for analysis
and modelling.
