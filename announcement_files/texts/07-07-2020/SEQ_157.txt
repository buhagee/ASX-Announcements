ACQUISITION OF TOTAL COVER AUSTRALIA ASSETS

Sequoia Financial Group Limited (Sequoia or The Company) is pleased to announce
that is entered into a Purchase of Assets Agreement with Total Cover Australia (TCA), via
the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary InterPrac Securities Pty Ltd (InterPrac
Securities).
TCA is a renowned multiple award winning Corporate Authorised Representative of the
Sequoia group through InterPrac Financial Planning. The business has averaged $800K
of annual income for the past three years (30% new business, 70% recurring income)
and will be absorbed into the 100% owned ‘direct’ client base of InterPrac Securities,
commencing July 2020.
This acquisition is the fourth purchase of a retiring InterPrac adviser’s portfolio over the
last 3 years. Sequoia sees these opportunities as being beneficial to all parties, as the
adviser realises the value of their asset, their clients retain the personalised service
they’ve previously received, and the Company is able to absorb these portfolios without
significant additional expense, making a strong contribution to our EBITDA. The
Company is currently looking for similar opportunities in NSW and QLD, at a time where
many ex-advisers of banks are looking for employment opportunities rather than
becoming a self-employed adviser.
TCA have elected to take part cash and part equity in the Company to maintain a
continued relationship with InterPrac Securities and the wider Sequoia group. Sequoia
will issue 1.5M shares immediately and make cash payments of $900K over the next two
years to complete the purchase.
