Bellevue Gold - Maiden Indicated Resource
860,000oz at 11.6g/t gold
Result includes high-grade core of 480,000oz at 15.5g/t gold;
Stage 2 drilling underway to upgrade and grow the 2.3Moz Resource in parallel
with project development work in 2H 2020
Key Points

•

Bellevue marks its transition to project developer with a maiden Indicated Resource of 860,000oz
grading 11.6g/t gold; The Resource has been independently estimated by a leading consultant

•

A further increase in the Indicated Resource is anticipated for the December quarter, with Stage
Two infill drilling to upgrade more of the Resource, which stands at 2.3Moz at 10.0g/t gold
(0.86Moz at 11.6g/t Indicated and 1.4Moz at 9.2g/t Inferred)

•

The majority of the Indicated Resource consists of a high-grade core of 480,000oz at 15.5g/t at the
Viago and Deacon lodes which remain open in all directions. Mineralisation sits within close
proximity to existing underground infrastructure, with further expansion drilling continuing in 2H
CY 2020

•

Underground drilling to commence in 2H CY 2020 with the benefit of a significantly lower cost
profile versus surface exploration and increased drilling productivity rates (per metre) from
underground; Step-out drilling is targeting multiple Down Hole Electro-Magnetic (DHEM)
conductors at the Project

•

Drill Intersects outside of the current Indicated Resource ready for future inclusion include 1:
o 2.3m @ 39g/t gold from 819m
o 3.9m @ 21g/t gold from 197.1m
o 2.4m @ 27.4g/t gold from 269.9m

•

Infill drilling from the Viago and Deacon Lodes confirm further exceptional grade with results
including:
o 5.0m @ 23.5 g/t gold from 481m
o 7.4m @ 15.4 g/t gold from 573.8m
o 6.1m @ 17.7 g/t gold from 561.0m

•

Three pronged drilling strategy underway focussing on growing the Indicated Resource, further
extensional drilling to grow the overall Resource by extending known mineralisation and further
planned regional drilling to follow up on the recent Government Well discovery 7km from the
existing Resource as well as other high priority Bellevue analogue targets

•

Work commenced by Industry leading mining consultant Entech Pty Ltd who was appointed as
study manager to advance the project as announced in the latest project update, for further
information click here (ASX 24/06/20)

•

Since the Company’s discovery drill hole in December quarter 2017 the Resource has grown to
2.3Moz at 10.0g/t gold (0.86Moz at 11.6g/t Indicated and 1.4Moz at 9.2g/t Inferred) and remains
open in all directions

•

The Indicated Resource was drilled on 40m x 40m and 40m x 20m or closer drill spacings; over
240,000m of diamond core drilling clearly demonstrates the robust and consistent nature of the
Bellevue high-grade mineralised system

Bellevue Gold (ASX: BGL) is pleased to announce a maiden Indicated Resource of 860,000oz at 11.6g/t gold at its
Bellevue Gold Project in West Australia.
The Indicated Resource forms part of Bellevue’s total 2.3Moz global Resource at 10g/t (860,000oz at 11.6g/t
Indicated and 1.4Moz at 9.2g/t Inferred).
A total of 240,000m of diamond drilling has now been completed at the Project, infilling selected areas of the
previous 80m x 80m drill grid on which the Inferred Resources were based, to 40m x 20m and 40m x 40m drill
spacing and in places a closer drill spacing. All drilling has been conducted as diamond core from surface.
Included in the Indicated Resource is a spectacular higher-grade core of mineralisation including 480,000 ounces
at 15.5g/t gold Indicated hosted in the Viago and Deacon Main Resource areas. This mineralisation is within a few
hundred metres of existing development and contains consistent high-grade high sulphide mineralisation that will
be targeted in the early mine life at the project.
Infill drilling is ongoing, with an increase to the Indicated Resource expected in the December quarter, which is
intended to convert more of the substantial Inferred Resource adjacent to high grade core as a priority. Drilling will
also target extensions to current Resources and the recent Government Well discovery which is located 7km from
the existing Resource (see ASX release dated 10th June, 2020) as well as other identified Bellevue analogue
outcropping targets to the north.

From a project perspective as announced in the recently released project update click here, industry leading mining
consultant Entech has been appointed as study manager and is assisting with ongoing studies. Tenders for both pit
wall rehabilitation, underground re-entry and development and stripping have been received from multiple
contractors with a strong interest shown in bidding for the works. Dewatering is also continuing according to plan.
A recently completed 3D LIDAR survey in the historical underground workings highlights the competency of the
surrounding ground conditions click here.
Bellevue Managing Director Steve Parsons said the Company now had two clear avenues for creating further
shareholder value.
“This Indicated Resource and the increases to come will underpin the economic studies on the project, which are
now well underway,” Mr Parsons said.
“Completion of these studies will mark the transition to the project development phase, which we believe will
demonstrate the technical and economic strengths which come from having a large, high-grade project with simple
metallurgy and access to existing infrastructure in a Tier-1 location.
“There is also huge potential to continue growing the overall inventory at Bellevue, where the mineralisation
remains open in multiple directions and we have numerous well-established targets, some with known
mineralisation.
“We are confident that the combination of economic and technical studies and Resource growth will drive further
increases in shareholder value.”

Technical Detail - Maiden High-Grade Indicated Resource Estimate

For personal use only

The reported Resource has been estimated on drilling completed up to mid-June 2020 and has concluded the first
significant infill drill program at the project; conducted over selected areas of the Bellevue Inferred Resource
during the first half of the 2020.
All conversion drilling has been conducted as NQ and HQ diamond core and has targeted a maximum drill
intersection spacing of 40m. A substantial amount of drilling has now been completed into the Resource areas
and has resulted in a de-risking of the project ahead of economic studies and potential future development. A
total of 240,000m of core drilling has now been completed by Bellevue Gold Limited since the commencement of
exploration in Q4 2017. During this period, the company has grown the Resource to 2.3Moz at 10.0g/t gold
(0.86Moz at 11.6g/t Indicated and 1.4Moz at 9.2g/t Inferred).
Following the maiden Indicated Resource, a number of high priority areas of the remaining Inferred Resource of
1.4Moz at 9.2g/t gold have been highlighted that will be followed up with additional infill drilling during Q3 CY
2020 from surface and underground platforms as these become available. In particular there is targeted drilling to
materially expand the higher-grade core of 480,000oz at 15.5g/t gold Indicated hosted in the Viago and Deacon
Main Resource areas by further conversion of Inferred category Resources.
The results from the infill drilling programs have correlated exceptionally well with the interpretation of the
previous Inferred Resource. The infill spacing has allowed continuity of the grades and lodes to be proven as well
as well as refining the geological and structural model. A key predicted element has been proven; with the infill
drilling highlighting gently plunging high grade shoots analogous with the historic Bellevue Mine across all new
discoveries.
Infill drilling has proven excellent continuity of the high-grade plunging mineralised shoots across the deposit areas
and allowed the refinement of the geological model.
Lode mineralisation is characterised by abundant fine-grained visible gold mineralisation associated with
pyrrhotite breccia textures within the polyphase quartz lodes. The lodes are all hosted within the same package of
mafic rocks of the Mount Goode Basalt.
Exceptional metallurgical recovery was recently confirmed from the Bellevue System with total gold extractions of
up to 99.3% through a combination of gravity and 48-hour cyanide leach bottle rolls. Significantly excellent gravity
recoveries of up to 92% of total gold recovered by the Knelson Concentrator were also achieved in testwork (refer
ASX release of 26th June 2020). The results are consistent with recoveries at the historic mine. The Company
confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in
the metallurgical testwork.
The Indicated Resource covers the newly discovered adjacent lodes of the Bellevue Mine and a minor shallow
Resource at the shallow historic Vanguard pit, located 1km to the north-east of the Bellevue Mine. A breakdown
of the Resource by domain is shown below in Table 2:

High Grade Core at the Deacon and Viago Lodes
Included in the Resource is a spectacular higher-grade core of mineralisation totalling 480,000oz at 15.5g/t gold
Indicated hosted in the Viago and Deacon Main Resource areas. This mineralisation is within a few hundred
metres of existing underground development and contains consistent high-grade mineralisation that will be
targeted in the early mine life at the project. This area is summarised in figure 1. Over half of the current
Indicated and global Resource is contained in the Viago and Deacon Lodes with both lodes open for Resource
growth in Indicated and Inferred categories with further drilling.

Deacon Lode
The Deacon Lode is the most recent discovery at the Bellevue Lode system and is located 400m east of the Bellevue
Mine and development. The Lode is analogous in style to the Bellevue Mine with a moderate westerly dip and high
sulphide content characterised by frequent abundant visible gold. Deacon is a substantial, high-grade gold discovery
and remains open in every direction. Infill drilling has only been conducted over a 300m x 180m section of the
2.2km of currently defined strike, meaning there is significant potential for further Resource conversion and

Viago Lode
The Viago lode is a second recent, major high-grade gold discovery in the Bellevue system. The Lode is a gently
plunging lode which extends to the south beneath the Bellevue lode and continues to the north into the hanging
wall at Bellevue. The interpretation at Viago has been refined from the original Inferred Resource with the
mineralisation contacting into the Bellevue structure and changing to a moderate westerly dip as it approaches
the Bellevue mine. The Viago Lode remains open and further extensional and infill drilling is scheduled in Q3/Q4
2020.

Vanguard Lode
The Vanguard Resource is a minor Resource area located 1km to the North-east of the Bellevue Lodes. The
current Resource is located under the historic shallow Vanguard oxide open pit that was mined at the previous
operations closure. A total of three diamond holes were completed by Bellevue Gold Limited to confirm the
historic grade control drilling under the old pit. Mineralisation style at Vanguard is analogous to the Bellevue Lode
system. Previously unreported results, the drill hole data of which is set out in Table 3, validated the existing
historical data and included:
•
•

DRDD243 4.0m @ 6.2 g/t gold from 77m
DRDD244 2.9m @ 5.4 g/t gold from 61m

The above results are the only intercepts in this lode.

Inferred Resource Only - Southern Belle and Bellevue Remnant Areas
The Southern Belle Lode is a high-grade domain hosted within the Bellevue Lode to the south of Viago. The lode
was historically discovered by mining company Plutonic Resources in the 1990’s in broad spaced step out drilling
and has not been followed up. Mineralisation extends to within 350m of surface and is located under Lake
Miranda. The Southern Belle area has significant potential for Resource growth and is open in every direction.
Due to the location a few hundred metres south of Viago, it is intended to conduct exploration and development
drilling from the underground development from Viago.
The Bellevue Remnant area covers structures around and in the footwall to the existing development. LIDAR
surveying is currently picking up the extents of previous stoping and verifying the model. Work so far has resulted
in an updated development model and revised boundaries of the stopes. As this work progresses the Bellevue
engineering team will look at opportunities to bring this material into higher classification on a local basis as the
mine progresses.

Global Resource Growth and New Discovery

For personal use only

Bellevue Gold Limited intends to grow the Resource through step out drilling and has commenced exploration
within the 20km Bellevue Mine Corridor. The regional potential of the Bellevue Project is demonstrated in Figure
4. The Bellevue Resource covers around 4 kilometres of strike of this trend. The recent maiden drill program at
Government Well, which reported 17m at 4.2g/t from 19m in the first drill hole (refer ASX release of 10th June
2020) is one such high-priority target for follow up.
In the near mine area all known lodes remain open down plunge and strike with a high potential for further blind
discovery analogous to the Deacon and Viago Lodes. The Bellevue system in general is also currently entirely
untested below about 650m where mineralisation is projected to continue at depth.
Exploration targeting these areas has commenced with a 10,000m program that will focus on known strike
extensions, potential repeats of the lode system to the east of Deacon and shallow targeting with the 20km
regional corridor including second phase drilling at Government Well.

Summary of the Resource Parameters

For personal use only

A summary of JORC Table 1 is provided below for compliance regarding the Mineral Resource reported within and
in-line with requirements of ASX listing rule 5.8.1.
Geology and Mineralisation
The project consists of a high-grade lode-gold deposit hosted in the Mount Goode Basalt. There is sufficient
confidence in the geological modelling of the orebody geometry to enable Indicated and Inferred Resource
classification. The current Resource upgrade represents the amalgamated Resource estimate for the project and
combined updates to the previously announced estimates and a new estimate for Vanguard which has not
previously been announced.
Please refer to the ASX announcements dated (refer 01/08/18, 22/10/2018, 05/02/2019, 15/07/19 and
24/2/2020) for details of previous Resource estimates.
Geology and Geological Interpretation
High-grade lode-gold structures at Bellevue are hosted in the Mount Goode Basalt. Mineralisation is characterised
by auriferous quartz veins ± sulphides and range from steeply west dipping to shallowly dipping in orientation
with an overall north south strike direction. The lodes are associated with a north-north west trending series of
regional shear zones and are occasionally offset by a series of late stage east trending normal faults and low angle
syn-min shears.
Geological and mineralisation constraints were generated based on gold grade assays and geological observations
such as presence of quartz veining and sulphide mineralisation. Structural and geological observations were used
to determine the overall attitude of the individual lodes.
Infill drilling by Bellevue Gold at the project targets a drill hole spacing of 40m strike by 40m down dip or better.
And this enables a higher degree of confidence in the geological interpretation. This follows the nominal initial
drill pattern spacing of approximately 80m by 80m that the previous Resource estimates have been based on.
The Global Mineral Resource area for the Bellevue Project has overall dimensions of 5,300 m (north) by 300 m
(east) and has been interpreted to extend to a maximum of 780m depth below surface.
Drilling Techniques, Sampling and assaying
The database consists of both historical data and that generated by Bellevue Gold. Only Bellevue Gold drilling was
used for the estimation of Deacon, Vlad and Viago. At Tribune, a mix of data has been used with the majority
being Bellevue Gold. For the remainder, such as Hamilton/Henderson, Vanguard and Southern Belle, the majority
of the data used has been historical.
Drilling by Bellevue Gold at the Project consists of a combination of RC, Diamond and diamond tail drill holes for a
total of 254,767 metres. This can be further subdivided into 114 RC drill holes for 10,276m, 498 diamond drill
holes for 239,523m and 17 RC drill holes with a diamond tail for 4,968m.
The majority of assays used in the Resource estimation were derived from NQ diamond drilling. Sampling was
nominally at 1m intervals. Core was cut in half, one half retained as a reference and the other sent for assay.

16

For personal use only

Bellevue Gold Assays were typically completed by Photon Assay whereby a 500g sample was crushed and dried to
produce a sample for photon technique gold analysis or additionally pulverised to produce a sub-sample for gold
determination by 50g fire assay with an AAS finish.
QAQC samples were inserted in the sample runs, comprising gold standards (CRM’s or Certified Reference
Materials) and commercially sourced blank material (barren basalt).
Estimation Methodology
Geological and mineralisation constraints were generated by Bellevue Gold geological staff in Leapfrog. The
constraints thus developed were subsequently used in geostatistics, variography, block model domain coding and
grade interpolation. Ordinary kriging was used for estimating Au. The constraints were coded to the drill hole
database and samples were composited to 1 metre downhole length. A parent block size of 10mE by 10mN by
10mRL was selected as an appropriate block size for estimation given the variability of the drill spacing and the
likely potential future underground mining methods. Variography was generated for the various lodes to enable
estimation via ordinary kriging. Hard boundaries were used for the estimation throughout.
Input composite counts for the estimates were variable and set at a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 8 and this
was dependent on domain sample numbers and geometry. Upper cuts on the grade data was set at between
5 g/t Au and 120 g/t Au with, where appropriate, an additional distance restriction set on the estimates whereby,
for example, any composite grades greater than a certain predetermined grade could not be used for block
estimates more than a specific distance from that high grade composite. The distance restriction was utilised in a
small minority of domains to prevent the spread of high-grade block estimates into low grade sample areas. Any
blocks not estimated in the first estimation pass were estimated in a second pass with an expanded search
neighbourhood with relaxed conditions to allow the domains to be fully estimated. Extrapolation of the estimated
gold grades is commonly approximately 80 metres beyond the edges of the drill hole data, however, may be
considered appropriate given the overall classification of those extended grade estimates as Inferred.
Bulk Density
Bulk densities between 2.8 g/cm3 and 3.1g/cm3 were assigned to mineralised zones at Bellevue based on test
work completed by Bellevue Gold Ltd. The higher densities are representative of mineralisation containing
significant proportions of sulphide minerals. Typically, the dry bulk densities were measured on 10cm billets of
competent drill core via the Archimedes principle (weight in air/weight in water method).
Classification
The Mineral Resource has been classified as a combination of Indicated and Inferred. The classification is based
on the relative confidence within the mineralised domain and is tempered by the drill spacing which has been
substantially infilled since the last Resource updates. In areas where the drill spacing is better than 40m strike by
40m down dip, relative confidence in the geological and mineralisation interpretations allow for classification of
the grade estimates as Indicated. In other areas where the drilling has a greater spacing than 40m strike by 40m
down dip where the confidence in the geological and mineralisation interpretation can only be considered low to
moderate, the grade estimates have been classified as Inferred.
Mining Factors or Assumptions
Underground mining is assumed however no rigorous application has been made of minimum mining width,
internal or external dilution.

Reporting Cut – off grade
A 3.5g/t Au cut-off grade was used to report the Mineral Resources. This cut-off grade is estimated to be the
minimum grade required for economic extraction at current metal prices.
Bellevue Gold Limited believes the Bellevue Gold Project has a reasonable prospect of eventually being mined by
taking into account the depth, thickness and grades of the deposits and proximity to existing infrastructure such
as roads and power.

The holes were sampled by NQ Diamond Core drilling.
Sampling was nominally at 1 m intervals however over narrow
zones of mineralisation it was as short as 0.2 m.
QAQC samples were inserted in the sample runs, comprising
gold standards (CRM’s or Certified Reference Materials) and
commercially sourced blank material (barren basalt).
Sampling practice is appropriate to the geology and
mineralisation of the deposit and complies with industry best
practice.

Diamond coring was undertaken with a modern truck mounted
rig and industry recognized quality contractor. Core (standard
tube), was drilled at HQ3 size (61.1mm) from surface until
competent ground was reached. The hole was then continued
with NQ size (45.1mm) to total depth.
The core was orientated using a Reflex Ez-Ori tool.

Diamond core recovery was measured for each run and
calculated as a percentage of the drilled interval, in weathered
material, core recoveries were generally 80 to 90%, in fresh
rock, the core recovery was excellent at 100%.
There has been no assessment of core sample recovery and
gold grade relationship.

All core was geologically logged. Lithology, veining, alteration,
mineralisation and weathering are recorded in the geology
table of the drill hole database. Final and detailed geological
logs were forwarded from the field following cutting and
sampling.

Assaying and laboratory procedures used are NATA certified
techniques for gold. Samples were prepared and assayed at
NATA accredited Minanalytical Laboratory Services in Perth.
All samples are initially sent to Minanalytical sample
Preparation facility in Kalgoorlie. Samples submitted for fire
assay are weighed, dried, coarse crushed and pulverized in
total to a nominal 85% passing 75 microns (method code
SP3010) and a 50 g subsample is assayed for gold by fire assay
with an AAS finish (method code FA50/AAS). Lower Detection
limit 0.005 ppm and upper detection limit 100 ppm gold.
Samples reporting above 100 ppm gold are re-assayed by 50
gram fire assay method FA50HAAS which has a lower detection
of 50 ppm and an upper detection limit of 800 ppm. This
method is used for very high grade samples. Both fire assay
methods are considered to be total analytical techniques.
Samples submitted for analysis via Photon assay technique
were dried, crushed to nominal 85% passing 2mm, linear split
and a nominal 500g sub sample taken (method code
PAP3512R)
The 500g sample is assayed for gold by PhotonAssay (method
code PAAU2) along with quality control samples including
certified reference materials, blanks and sample duplicates.
About the MinAnalytical PhotonAssay Analysis Technique:o
Developed by CSIRO and the Chrysos Corporation,
the PhotonAssay technique is a fast and chemical
free alternative to the traditional fire assay process
and utilizes high energy x-rays. The process is nondestructive on and utilises a significantly larger
sample than the conventional 50g fire assay.
o
MinAnalytical has thoroughly tested and validated
the PhotonAssay process with results benchmarked
against conventional fire assay.
o
The National Association of Testing Authorities
(NATA), Australia’s national accreditation body for
laboratories, has issued MinAnalytical with

More recently and particularly in terms of the geophysical
work reviewed the companies involved were Plutonic
Operations Limited, Barrick Gold Corporation and Jubilee
Mines NL
The Bellevue Project is located within the Agnew-Wiluna
portion of the Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone belt,
approximately 40 km NNW of Leinster. The project area
comprises felsic to intermediate volcanic sequences, metasediments, ultramafic komatiite flows, Jones Creek
Conglomerates and tholeiitic meta basalts (Mt Goode
Basalt) which hosts the known gold deposits.
The major gold deposits in the area lie on or adjacent to
north-northwest trending fault zones.
The Bellevue gold deposit is hosted by the partly tholeiitic
meta-basalts of the Mount Goode Basalts in an area of
faulting, shearing and dilation to form a shear hosted lode
style quartz/basalt breccia.

These relationships are particularly
important in the reporting of Exploration
Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its
nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole
lengths are reported, there should be a
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down
hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with
scales) and tabulations of intercepts
should be included for any significant
discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and
appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and
high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including
(but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples
– size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock

Commentary

Measures taken to ensure that data has not been
corrupted by, for example, transcription or keying errors,
between its initial collection and its use for Mineral
Resource estimation purposes.

Data templates with lookup tables and fixed formatting are used
for logging, spatial and sampling data. Data transfer is electronic
via e-mail. Sample numbers are unique and pre-numbered bags
are used. These methods all minimise the potential of these types
of errors.

Data validation procedures used.

Data validation checks are run by the database management
consultant. All data is loaded into Data Shed and validated, with
exported data then loaded into mining software for further
checks.

Comment on any site visits undertaken by the Competent
Person and the outcome of those visits.

A site visit was made to the Bellevue Project by Brian Wolfe
during diamond drilling to verify sampling integrity and recovery.
No issues were encountered. A site inspection was undertaken
and relevant drill core inspected.

If no site visits have been undertaken indicate why this is
the case.

N/A

Confidence in (or conversely, the uncertainty of) the
geological interpretation of the mineral deposit.

The project consists of high-grade lode-gold deposit styles and
the confidence in the geological interpretation is variable.
•

Where sufficient drilling exists on an approximate scale of 80m
strike by 80m down dip, confidence may be considered
moderate to good. Where drill spacing is on a scale of 40m strike
by 40m down dip, confidence may be considered good. In other
areas where the drill spacing is greater than 80m strike by 80m
down dip, confidence may be considered low to moderate.

Nature of the data used and of any assumptions made.

The interpretation used was based on diamond and RC drilling
data. Geological and gold assay data was utilized in the
interpretation. The database consists of both historical data and
that generated by Bellevue Gold. Only Bellevue Gold drilling was
used for the estimation of Deacon, Vlad and Viago. At Tribune, a
mix of data has been used with the majority being Bellevue Gold.
For the remainder, such as Hamilton/Henderson, Vanguard and
Southern Belle, the majority of the data used has been historical.

The effect, if any, of alternative interpretations on
Mineral Resource estimation.

Alternative interpretations have not been considered for the
purpose of Resource estimation as the current interpretation is
thought to represent the best fit based on the current level of
data.

The use of geology in guiding and controlling Mineral
Resource estimation.

Key features are based on the presence of quartz veining and
sulphide mineralisation in conjunction with gold grade assays.

The factors affecting continuity both of grade and
geology.

In the CP's opinion there is sufficient information available from
drilling to build a plausible geological interpretation that is of
appropriate confidence for the classification of the Resource.

The extent and variability of the Mineral Resource
expressed as length (along strike or otherwise), plan
width, and depth below surface to the upper and lower
limits of the Mineral Resource

The Mineral Resource area has overall dimensions of dimensions
of 5,300 m (north) by 300 m (east) and has been interpreted to

Estimation and
modelling techniques

JORC Code explanation
The nature and appropriateness of the estimation
technique(s) applied and key assumptions, including
treatment of extreme grade values, domaining,
interpolation parameters and maximum distance of
extrapolation from data points. If a computer assisted
estimation method was chosen include a description of
computer software and parameters used.

Commentary
Geological and mineralisation constraints were generated on the
above basis by Bellevue Gold geological staff in. The constraints
thus developed were subsequently used in geostatistics,
variography, block model domain coding and grade
interpolation. A combination of ordinary kriging and inverse
distance was used for estimating Au. The constraints were coded
to the drill hole database and samples were composited to 1m
downhole length. A parent block size of 10mE by 210mN by
10mRL was selected as an appropriate block size for estimation
given the variability of the drill spacing and the likely potential
future underground mining methods. Variography was
generated for the various lodes to enable estimation via ordinary
kriging. Hard boundaries were used for the estimation
throughout.
Input composite counts for the estimates were variable and set at
a minimum of between 4 a maximum of 8 and this was dependent
on domain sample numbers and geometry. Any blocks not
estimated in the first estimation pass were estimated in a second
pass with an expanded search neighbourhood and relaxed
condition to allow the domains to be fully estimated.
Extrapolation of the drill hole composite data is commonly
approximately 80m beyond the edges of the drill hole data,
however, may be considered appropriate given the overall
classification of such extended grade estimates as Inferred.

The availability of check estimates, previous estimates
and/or mine production records and whether the Mineral
Resource estimate takes appropriate account of such
data.

At Bellevue, previous Resource estimates are >20 years old and it
may not be appropriate to make a direct comparison due to
differences in techniques. Mining activity has taken place at
Bellevue over an extended period however records are
fragmented and not currently in a form where a meaningful
comparison may be made. Current estimated grades at Bellevue
are approximately in line with historical mined grades. The
available mined out stope shapes have been used to deplete the
current mineral Resource where appropriate. In the case of the
Bellevue North, Hamilton, Tribune, Southern Belle Deacon, Vlad,
Viago and Tribune Lodes , the CP is not aware of any previous
Resource estimates

The assumptions made regarding recovery of byproducts.

No by-products are assumed.

Estimation of deleterious elements or other non-grade
variables of economic significance (e.g. sulphur for acid
mine drainage characterisation).

No other elements have been assayed.

In the case of block model interpolation, the block size in
relation to the average sample spacing and the search
employed.

The parent block size within the estimated domain is
10mN x10mE x 10mRL, with sub-celling for domain volume
resolution. The parent block size was chosen based on
mineralised bodies dimension and orientation, estimation
methodology and relates to a highly variable drill section spacing
and likely method of future underground production. The search
ellipse was oriented in line with the interpreted mineralized
bodies. Search ellipse dimensions were chosen to encompass
adjacent drill holes on sections and adjacent lines of drilling
along strike and designed to fully estimate the mineralized
domains.

Any assumptions behind modelling of selective mining
units.

No assumption on selective mining were made.

Any assumptions about correlation between variables.

Moisture

JORC Code explanation
Description of how the geological interpretation was
used to control the Resource estimates.

The geological model domained the mineralized lode material
and were used as hard boundaries for the estimation.

Discussion of basis for using or not using grade cutting or
capping.

A number of extremely high-grade composites have been
identified which are considered true outliers to the data.
Dependent on the domain, these high grades have been cut to
between 5g/t Au and 120g/t Au. Where appropriate, a distance
restriction has been applied on the grade estimates whereby, for
example, block estimates greater than a specified distance from
chigh grade composites greater than a specified grade cannot
use those high-grade composites for that block. This strategy of
distance restriction has only been used for a few domains where
it was determined to be necessary to prevent the spread of high
grades into low grade areas.

The process of validation, the checking process used, the
comparison of model data to drill hole data, and use of
reconciliation data if available.

The block model estimates were validated by visual comparison
of block grades to drill hole composites, comparison of
composite and block model statistics and swath plots of
composite versus whole block model grades. Reconciliation data
is generally not in a suitable format to allow meaningful
comparison at this stage.

Assumptions made regarding possible mining methods,
minimum mining dimensions and internal (or, if
applicable, external) mining dilution. It is always
necessary as part of the process of determining
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction to
consider potential mining methods, but the assumptions
made regarding mining methods and parameters when
estimating Mineral Resources may not always be
rigorous. Where this is the case, this should be reported
with an explanation of the basis of the mining
assumptions made.

Metallurgical factors or
assumptions

Commentary

The basis for assumptions or predictions regarding
metallurgical amenability. It is always necessary as part
of the process of determining reasonable prospects for
eventual economic extraction to consider potential
metallurgical methods, but the assumptions regarding
metallurgical treatment processes and parameters made
when reporting Mineral Resources may not always be
rigorous. Where this is the case, this should be reported
with an explanation of the basis of the metallurgical
assumptions made.

The tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.

A 3.5g/t Au cut-off grade was used to report the Mineral
Resources. This cut-off grade is estimated to be the minimum
grade required for economic extraction.

Underground mining is assumed however no rigorous
application has been made of minimum mining width, internal or
external dilution.

Initial gravity and cyanide leach recovery test work completed on
composite samples from the Tribune lode have been publicly
reported on 29th June 2018 and can be summarized as:
•

Excellent total gold extractions of up to 98.8%
through a combination of gravity and 48-hour cyanide
leach bottle rolls
•
Excellent gravity recoveries of up to 82.5% of total
gold recovered by the Knelson Concentrator prior to
cyanide leaching.
The latest metallurgical test work across the Bellevue, Tribune,
Deacon and Viago lodes was reported on 26 June 2020 and can
be summarised as :
•

Overall gravity and leach recoveries from all lodes
averaging 97.8%
•
Exceptional gravity-only component recovery from all
lodes with results ranging from 73.6%to 91.7%
•
Standard reagent consumptions from all lodes
•
Gold deportment well distributed across all size
fractions

the status of early consideration of these potential
environmental impacts should be reported. Where these
aspects have not been considered this should be reported
with an explanation of the environmental assumptions
made
Whether assumed or determined. If assumed, the basis
for the assumptions. If determined, the method used,
whether wet or dry, the frequency of the measurements,
the nature, size and representativeness of the samples.

No environmental factors or assumptions have been made.

Direct measurements of Dry Bulk Densities have been taken for
the all Lodes. Typically, a 10cm billet has been determined on a
representative basis in the mineralized portion. No direct
information is available for the densities used in the historical
database.

The bulk density for bulk material must have been
measured by methods that adequately account for void
spaces (vugs, porosity, etc), moisture and differences
between rock and alteration zones within the deposit,

The applied value for across all lodes varies between 2.9gm/cm3
and 3.1 gm/cm3.

Discuss assumptions for bulk density estimates used in
the evaluation process of the different materials.

The bulk density values were assigned as a single value to the
mineralized zones on the assumption that all mineralisation is in
fresh rock.

The basis for the classification of the Mineral Resources
into varying confidence categories

The Mineral Resource has been classified as Indicated and
Inferred. The classification is based on the relative confidence in
the mineralised domain countered by variable drill spacing. The
classification of Indicated is only considered in areas where the
drill spacing is better than 40m strike by 40m down dip.

Classification

Audits or reviews

Commentary

Whether appropriate account has been taken of all
relevant factors (i.e. relative confidence in tonnage/grade
estimations, reliability of input data, confidence in
continuity of geology and metal values, quality, quantity
and distribution of the data).

The input data is comprehensive in its coverage of the
mineralisation and does not favour or misrepresent in-situ
mineralisation.

Whether the result appropriately reflects the Competent
Person’s view of the deposit.

The Mineral Resource estimate appropriately reflects the view of
the Competent Persons.

The results of any audits or reviews of Mineral Resource
estimates.

No audits or reviews have been undertaken to the CP’s
knowledge.

Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy
and confidence level in the Mineral Resource estimate
using an approach or procedure deemed appropriate by
the Competent Person. For example, the application of
statistical or geostatistical procedures to quantify the
relative accuracy of the Resource within stated
confidence limits, or, if such an approach is not deemed
appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors that
could affect the relative accuracy and confidence of the
estimate

The relative accuracy of the Mineral Resource estimate is
reflected in the reporting of the Mineral Resource as per the
guidelines of the 2012 JORC Code.

The statement should specify whether it relates to global
or local estimates, and, if local, state the relevant
tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and
economic evaluation. Documentation should include
assumptions made and the procedures used.

The statement relates to global estimates of tonnes and grade.

The validation of the block model shows moderately good
correlation of the input data to the estimated grades.

Criteria

JORC Code explanation
These statements of relative accuracy and confidence of
the estimate should be compared with production data,
where available

Commentary
Mining activity has taken place at Bellevue over an extended
period however records are fragmented and not currently in a
form where a meaningful comparison may be made.
