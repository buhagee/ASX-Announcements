Updated Earnings Guidance
ASX ANNOUNCEMENT

Earnings guidance updated following Emerging Companies Fund’s
performance fee

Australian Ethical Investment (ASX:AEF) advises that its Emerging Companies Fund returned 13.9% after all fees
(including performance fees) for wholesale investors1 for the year to 30 June 2020 against its Benchmark2 of
negative 7.4%.
A performance fee of $3.64 million, calculated as 20% of the Fund’s one year outperformance over its
Benchmark, was earned by Australian Ethical in its capacity as the Responsible Entity of the Fund.
The performance fee revenue, less tax and after a proportionate increase in the contribution to the Australian
Ethical Foundation, adds to the expected Underlying Profit after Tax (UPAT) announced on 22 June 2020. The
UPAT for the year ending 30 June 2020 is now expected to be between $9.0 and $9.5 million, a mid-point
increase of 41% on the 12 months ended 30 June 2019.
The Australian Ethical Emerging Companies Fund has been very successful since it launched in 2015, producing
consistent outperformance for investors. The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of small capitalisation
companies and combines ethics with investment expertise to deliver market leading returns and a positive
impact.
More information will be provided when full year results are announced in late August 2020.
This announcement is authorised by the Board.
