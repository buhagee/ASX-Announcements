Update on the Iberdrola Offer – satisfaction of the FIRB Condition

For personal use only

On Tuesday, 7 July 2020, Iberdrola Australia provided to Infigen and released to the ASX a
notice given under subsection 630(4) of the Corporations Act declaring that the FIRB Condition
has been fulfilled.
The effect of this notice is that the Iberdrola Offer is now:
(a)

free of the FIRB Condition; and

(b)

subject to only one Defeating Condition, being the Minimum Acceptance Condition.

Infigen Security Holders should note that the Original Target’s Statement was dated and
released to the ASX before Iberdrola Australia provided the notice described above and,
accordingly, contains a number of statements to the effect that the Iberdrola Offer is subject to
the FIRB Condition, which are now outdated (see, among other places, the Chairman’s Letter,
part 3 of section 1.2, section 3, section 4.1, section 5.2, section 5.3 and Attachment A of that
document).

3.

Infigen Directors’ recommendation

The Infigen Directors continue to unanimously recommend that Infigen Security Holders
ACCEPT the Iberdrola Offer and will accept, or procure the acceptance of, the Iberdrola Offer
in respect of any Infigen Stapled Securities they own or control or otherwise have a Relevant
Interest in, in each case, in the absence of a Superior Proposal.
The Infigen Directors’ reasons for recommending that Infigen Security Holders ACCEPT the
Iberdrola Offer are set out in section 1 of the Original Target’s Statement.
The Infigen Directors note that:
(a)

as described above, the Iberdrola Offer is now subject to only one Defeating Condition,
being the Minimum Acceptance Condition; and

(b)

as stated in part 3 of section 1.2 of the Original Target’s Statement, the Pre-Bid
Agreement, in addition to the Infigen Directors’ decision to recommend the Iberdrola
Offer, in the absence of a Superior Proposal, continues to provide the Infigen Directors
with a reasonable basis to consider that the Minimum Acceptance Condition is likely to
be satisfied during the Offer Period, unless a Superior Proposal emerges.
