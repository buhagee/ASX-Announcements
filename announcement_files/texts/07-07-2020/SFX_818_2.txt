THUNDERBIRD MINERAL SANDS PROJECT
Sheffield Resources Limited (“Sheffield” or “the Company”) continued to review development options of
its world-class Thunderbird Mineral Sands Project (“Thunderbird” or “Project”) with two core objectives:

For personal use only

i)
ii)

Defining a lower capital cost and more readily financeable project scope; and
Preserving cash reserves to ensure a cash runway well into 2021.

Project Scope
An internal project development review, led by mineral sands expert Bruce Griffin, considered a range of
Project scale and product mix options. A small range of development strategies that all include a zircon
rich non- magnetic stream in conjunction with alternate ilmenite streams were identified.
The BFSU flowsheet included a Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) which produced Premium Zircon and
Zircon in Concentrate products. The removal of the MSP from the flowsheet will materially reduce upfront
capital costs and produce a zircon and leucoxene rich non-magnetic concentrate. The market for nonmagnetic concentrates has emerged as an alternative route to market for zircon in recent years and
continues to grow strongly. Going forward, Sheffield intends to undertake further evaluation of ilmenite
product options, through engagement with potential strategic and funding partners and through further
test work of ilmenite options.
The review identified alternative ilmenite streams which would be suitable for direct sale in the sulfate
pigment or chloride slag market significantly reducing the ilmenite product market risk.
Thunderbird remains a Tier 1 mineral sands project in a Tier 1 jurisdiction. Thunderbird is fully permitted
and able to be brought into production at a time when a gap between consumption and production of
both zircon and titanium minerals is expected to emerge.
Project Development
During the quarter, IHC Robbins progressed their test work program on a range of potential magnetic and
non-magnetic products.
The project development review identified a requirement for further test work. IHC Robbins have been
engaged to complete this test work with completion targeted for Q3 2020.
Offtake Partners
Information from completed test work has been shared with offtake partners and engagement with these
offtake groups have been positive, with interest remaining strong for the forecast products from
Thunderbird.
Sheffield dispatched a representative twenty-tonne bulk ore sample for offtake partner Bengbu
Zhongheng New Materials S&T Co. Ltd (Bengbu). The sample arrived during the quarter and Bengbu have
commenced metallurgical test work relating to the production of an ilmenite concentrate as a chloride
slag feedstock.
Early Works Program
The suspension of care and maintenance activities was completed during the quarter.
The Company prepared COVID19 compliant travel and work procedures for environmental and baseline
water monitoring work programs. These work programs and arrangements for security and caretaking will
ensure the Project remains compliant and retains all required Project approvals in readiness for future
construction activities.

2

Aboriginal and Community Engagement
The Company held COVID19 appropriate engagement with key Project stakeholders regarding the
Company’s strategy and particularly the suspension of care and maintenance activities at the
Thunderbird Project.

For personal use only

During the quarter, Sheffield issued 2.8m shares at $1.05 per share to Kimberley Sustainable
Development Pty Ltd, as partial consideration pursuant to the execution of the Thunderbird Project Coexistence Agreement (Agreement) by the parties on 31 October 2018. A one-off milestone payment of
$1m, being further and final consideration pursuant to the execution of the Agreement, is scheduled for
payment by the Company in the September quarter.
Markets
The mineral sands market has performed well considering the global economic conditions and
uncertainty that has prevailed in 2020.
China has rebounded well, with most zircon industry groups operating closer to capacity and expectations
are for a stronger second half of the year. Europe has restarted zircon operations more recently, with
steady ramp up to near full capacity forecast in the near term. India initiated a hard stop with limited
industry operating and with timing for resumption not yet defined. Zircon prices continued to decline in
the quarter, with prices settling at a range of US$1350 - US$1500 per tonne.
The titanium feedstock market appears to be in balance, with little impact to pricing over the quarter.
Outside of China, COVID19 impacted titanium dioxide pigment consumers in Q2 and is expected to impact
titanium dioxide pigment consumption in Q3 2020. Titanium feedstock demand is expected to weaken
in 2H 2020.
While some near term weakness is expected in 2H 2020, both markets are still forecast to have
significant supply constraints in the mid to long term and Sheffield is well placed to supply material into
what will be a tight market in the future.
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
A review of exploration tenure continued with a focus to reduce expenditure commitments and outgoings.
At the Dampier Project, Sheffield voluntarily surrendered non-core exploration tenure from eighteen
tenements. No change occurred to the Eneabba Project which is predominantly under retention status
and the McCalls Projects which is fully under retention status. The Derby East Project tenure also remains
unchanged. These changes further reduced annual expenditure commitments by approximately $0.5m.
Dampier Project
Sheffield continued its review of Dampier exploration tenements, voluntarily reducing the non-core
tenement holdings by a further 1,018 square kilometres to cumulate saving in the order of $0.5m per
annum.
In total, the Company retains exploration tenements totalling 1,427 square kilometres. Sheffield remains
focused on remaining key tenure to support the development of the Thunderbird Mineral Sands Project.
Eneabba & McCalls Projects
Sheffield’s 100% owned Eneabba Project is located approximately 230km north of Perth in Western
Australia’s Midwest region. The Eneabba Project has a Mineral Resource inventory totalling 193.3 million
tonnes @ 3.0% HM containing 4.8 million tonnes of Valuable Heavy Mineral above various HM cut-offs
(Measured, Indicated and Inferred) (refer to ASX announcement 3 October 2018 and 24 September
2019). The mineralisation is across seven Mineral Resources including Yandanooka, Durack, Drummond
Crossing, Robbs Cross, Thomson, West Mine North and Ellengail.

For personal use only

The McCalls Mineral Sands Project (McCalls) is located 110km to the north of Perth near the town of
Gingin. Across two deposits (McCalls and Mindarra Springs) the Project has a Mineral Resource of 5,800
million tonnes @ 1.4% HM above a 1.1% HM cut-off (Indicated and Inferred). The McCalls Project contains
67 million tonnes of chloride ilmenite grading 59-66% TiO2 and is considered a longer-term strategic
asset (refer to ASX announcement 03 October 2018 and 24 September 2019).
Both HM deposits in the McCalls Project have retention status. A review of all project data and Mineral
Resource data for Eneabba & McCalls Projects continued during the Quarter.
Derby East Project
The Derby East Project comprises of a large occurrence of construction quality sand, located 24km east
of the Port of Derby. No work was undertaken during the Quarter.
CORPORATE ACTIVITIES
The Sheffield Board renewal process continued with the appointment of Mr Bruce Griffin as an Executive
Director of the Company. Mr Griffin joined the executive management team as Commercial Director
following his recent consulting engagement, leading an internal study to assess a range of development
options for the Thunderbird Project.
The Board remains focused upon generation of long-term shareholder value whilst navigating the
COVID19 global pandemic and related market volatility and engagement with potential strategic partners
and other key stakeholders is ongoing.
A review of non-core assets resulted in the disposal of accommodation units, further strengthening the
cash position by $1.75m during the quarter.
Completed corporate and organisational changes have reduced forecast cash expenditure for the
remainder of 2020 by approximately 50% compared the first half of the year, further extending the cash
runaway into 2021.
As at 30 June 2020, Sheffield held cash reserves of approximately A$7.1 million (unaudited).
This announcement is authorised by the Board of Sheffield Resources Limited.

The Ore Reserve estimate was prepared by Entech Pty Ltd, an experienced and prominent mining
engineering consultancy with appropriate mineral sands experience in accordance with the JORC Code
(2012 Edition). The Ore Reserve was estimated using all available geological and relevant drill hole and
assay data, including mineralogical sampling and test work on mineral recoveries and final product
qualities. The Company is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information
included in the Ore Reserve estimate and confirms that all material assumptions and technical
parameters underpinning the estimate continue to apply and have not materially changed. The Ore
Reserve estimate is based on the current, July 2016 Thunderbird Mineral Resource estimate, announced
to the ASX on 5 July 2016. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were converted too Proved and
Probable Ore Reserves respectively, subject to mine design, modifying factors and economic evaluation.

Night Train: Estimates of Mineral Assemblage are presented as percentages of the Heavy Mineral (HM) component of the deposit, as determined by magnetic separation,
QEMSCANTM and XRF for one of 12 composite samples. Magnetic fractions were analysed by QEMSCANTM for mineral determination as follows: Ilmenite: 40-70% TiO2 >90%
Liberation; leucoxene: 70-90% TiO2 >90% Liberation; High titanium leucoxene (HiTi leucoxene) and rutile 90% TiO2 >90% Liberation, and zircon: 66.7% ZrO2+HfO2 >90% Liberation.
The non-magnetic fraction was submitted for XRF analysis and minerals determined as follows: zircon: ZrO2+HfO2/0.667 and HiTi leucoxene: TiO2/0.94. HM assemblage
determination was by the QEMSCANTM process for 11 of 12 composite samples which uses observed mass and chemistry to classify particles according to their average chemistry,
and then report mineral abundance by dominant % mass in particle. For the TiO2 minerals the following breakpoints were used to distinguish between Ilmenite 40% to 70% TiO2,
leucoxene 70% to 90% TiO2, HiTi leucoxene and rutile > 90%, Screening of the heavy mineral was not required. Thunderbird: estimates of Mineral Assemblage are presented as

Night Train: The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Optiro Pty Ltd and first disclosed under the JORC Code (2012) refer to ASX announcement 31 January 2019 for
further details including Table 1. The Night Train Mineral Resource reported above 1.2% heavy mineral (HM) cut-off is inclusive of (not additional to) the Mineral Resource reported
above 2.0% HM cut-off. Thunderbird: The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Optiro Pty Ltd and first disclosed under the JORC Code (2012) refer to ASX announcement
5 July 2016 for further details including Table 1. The Dampier Project Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of (not additional to) Ore Reserves. Thunderbird: The Mineral
Resource reported above 3.0% HM cut-off is inclusive of (not additional to) the Mineral Resource reported above 7.5% HM cut-off.

Tonnes and grades have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy and confidence level of the estimate, thus the sum of columns may not equal.

Night Train: Estimates of Mineral Assemblage are presented as percentages of the HM component of the deposit, as determined by magnetic separation, QEMSCANTM and XRF
for one of 12 composite samples. Magnetic fractions were analysed by QEMSCANTM for mineral determination as follows: Ilmenite: 40-70% TiO2 >90% Liberation; leucoxene: 7090% TiO2 >90% Liberation; High titanium leucoxene (HiTi leucoxene) and rutile 90% TiO 2 >90% Liberation, and zircon: 66.7% ZrO2+HfO2 >90% Liberation. The non-magnetic
fraction was submitted for XRF analysis and minerals determined as follows: zircon: ZrO2+HfO2/0.667 and HiTi leucoxene: TiO 2/0.94. HM assemblage determination- was by the
QEMSCANTM process for 11 of 12 composite samples which uses observed mass and chemistry to classify particles according to their average chemistry, and then report mineral
abundance by dominant % mass in particle. For the TiO2 minerals the following breakpoints were used to distinguish between Ilmenite 40% to 70% TiO2, Leucoxene 70% to 90%
TiO2, HiTi leucoxene and rutile > 90%, Screening of the heavy mineral was not required. Thunderbird: estimates of Mineral Assemblage are presented as percentages of the HM
component of the deposit, as determined by magnetic separation, QEMSCANTM and XRF. Magnetic fractions were analysed by QEMSCANTM for mineral determination as follows:
Ilmenite: 40-70% TiO2 >90% Liberation; leucoxene: 70-94% TiO2 >90% Liberation; HiTi leucoxene: >94% TiO2 >90% Liberation; and zircon: 66.7% ZrO2+HfO2 >90% Liberation.
The non-magnetic fraction was submitted for XRF analysis and minerals determined as follows: zircon: ZrO 2+HfO2/0.667 and HiTi leucoxene: TiO2/0.94.

The Mineral Resource estimates were prepared by Optiro Pty Ltd and first disclosed under the JORC Code (2012) refer 03 October 2018 ASX announcement for Yandanooka,
Durack, Drummond Crossing, West Mine North and Ellengail. Refer to December 2017 Quarterly Activities Report for Robbs Cross and Thomson deposits for further details
2All tonnages and grades have been rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimate, thus the sums of columns may not equal.
3Total heavy mineral (HM) %: Samples from 1989 and 1996 (Drummond Crossing, Ellengail and West Mine North) were analysed using a -75 µm slimes / +2 mm oversize screen.
Separation of HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.84 g/ml) from the -710µm+75µm fraction.
4Total HM %: RGC samples from 1998 and Iluka samples (Drummond Crossing, Durack, Ellengail, West Mine North and Yandanooka) were analysed using a -53 µm slimes /
+2 mm oversize screen. Separation of total HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.90 g/ml) from the -710µm+53µm fraction.
5Total HM %: Samples from Robbs Cross and Thomson analysed by Diamantina Laboratories in Perth using a -45 µm slimes / +1 mm oversize screen (method
DIA_HLS_45µm_1mm). Separation of total HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.96g/ml) from the -45 µm+1mm fraction.
6Total HM %: Samples from Drummond Crossing, Durack, West Mine North and Yandanooka were analysed by Western Geolabs in Perth using a -53 µm slimes / +1 mm oversize
screen. Separation of total HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.96 g/ml) from the +53µm-1mm fraction.
7Reported below an upper cut-off grade of 35% slimes.
8Estimates of mineral assemblage are presented as percentages of the total HM component of the deposit, as determined by QEMSCANTM analysis. For the TiO2 minerals specific
breakpoints are used to distinguish between rutile (>95% TiO2), leucoxene (85-95% TiO2) and ilmenite (<55-85% TiO2).
9At West Mine North and Ellengail mineral assemblage data determined by Iluka using Method 4 (HM concentrate is separated into magnetics and non-magnetics) was used with
the Sheffield QEMSCANTM data
10At Ellengail mineral assemblage data determined by Iluka using Method 3 (magnetic separation and XRF) was used with the Sheffield QEMSCANTM data and Iluka Method 4
11The in-situ assemblage grade is determined by multiplying the percentage of HM by the percentage of each valuable heavy mineral within the heavy mineral assemblage at the
resource block model scale.

Durack, Drummond Crossing, West Mine North and Ellengail. Refer to December 2017 Quarterly Activities Report for Robbs Cross and Thomson deposits for further details
2All tonnages and grades have been rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimate, thus the sums of columns may not equal.
3Total heavy mineral (HM) %: Samples from 1989 and 1996 (Drummond Crossing, Ellengail and West Mine North) were analysed using a -75µm slimes / +2 mm oversize screen.
Separation of HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.84 g/ml) from the -710µm+75µm fraction.
4Total HM %: RGC samples from 1998 and Iluka samples (Drummond Crossing, Durack, Ellengail, West Mine North and Yandanooka) were analysed using a -53 µm slimes /
+2 mm oversize screen. Separation of total HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.90 g/ml) from the -710µm+53µm fraction.
5Total HM %: Samples from Robbs Cross and Thomson analysed by Diamantina Laboratories in Perth using a -45µm slimes / +1mm oversize screen (method
DIA_HLS_45µm_1mm). Separation of total HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.96g/ml) from the -45 µm+1mm fraction.
6Total HM %: Samples from Drummond Crossing, Durack, West Mine North and Yandanooka were analysed by Western Geolabs in Perth using a -53 µm slimes / +1 mm oversize
screen. Separation of total HM% was by heavy liquid TBE (density 2.96g/ml) from the +53µm-1mm fraction.
7Reported below an upper cut-off grade of 35% slimes.
8Estimates of mineral assemblage are presented as percentages of the total HM component of the deposit, as determined by QEMSCANTM analysis. For the TiO2 minerals specific
breakpoints are used to distinguish between rutile (>95% TiO2), leucoxene (85-95% TiO2) and ilmenite (<55-85% TiO2).
9At West Mine North and Ellengail mineral assemblage data determined by Iluka using Method 4 (HM concentrate is separated into magnetics and non-magnetics) was used with
the Sheffield QEMSCANTM data

“intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “potential”, "predict", "foresee", "proposed", "aim", "target", "opportunity", “could”, “nominal”,
“conceptual” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements, opinions and estimates included in this report are based on
assumptions and contingencies which are subject to change without notice, as are statements about market and industry trends,
which are based on interpretations of current market conditions. Forward-looking statements are provided as a general guide
only and should not be relied on as a guarantee of future performance. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a range
of variables that could cause actual results to differ from estimated results and may cause the Company’s actual performance
and financial results in future periods to materially differ from any projections of future performance or results expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. So there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will not materially differ from
these forward-looking statements.
