AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT
7 July 2020

First Significant Australian EdenCrete® Order
Eden Innovations Ltd (Eden) (ASX: EDE) is pleased to advise that it has received
its first significant purchase order from Parchem Construction Supplies Pty Ltd
(“Parchem”), the Australian and New Zealand distributor of the EdenCrete®
products.
The purchase order, worth US$65,274 (approx. A$94,040), is for a 20-foot
container load of EdenCrete® products, comprising mostly EdenCrete® and a
limited quantity of EdenCrete®Pz, that will be supplied from Eden’s plant in
Littleton, Colorado, USA.
This order is a very welcome development and follows significant interest in
EdenCrete® products being shown by a range of companies in Australia and New
Zealand, that in turn has resulted in a number of successful trials of EdenCrete®
products being carried out by potential customers.

BACKGROUND
EdenCrete® is Eden’s 100% owned, proprietary carbon-strengthened concrete additive that enhances a
wide range of performance characteristics of the concrete including compressive strength, flexural
strength, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, reduced permeability, increased modulus of elasticity,
and reduced shrinkage, delivering stronger, tougher, more durable and longer lasting concrete.
One of the primary target markets for EdenCrete® is improving the performance of concrete used in the
construction and maintenance of concrete roads, bridges and other infrastructure, particularly where
it is subject to heavy wear, freeze/thaw weather conditions and/or high levels of added salt.
Additionally, it has potential for use in most other concrete applications including high-rise building
construction, marine and coastal applications, water storage and pipelines, hardstand areas,
warehouses, shotcrete applications and pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete structures and products.

Gregory H. Solomon
Executive Chairman
This announcement was authorised by the above signatory.
