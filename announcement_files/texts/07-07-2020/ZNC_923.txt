Funds raised under the Placement will enable Zenith to progress an active exploration program
over the coming period, which is expected to result in significant news flow as drilling progresses
at the Company’s 100%-owned Red Mountain Gold Project (“Red Mountain”). Exciting, highgrade drill results were recently returned from the maiden RC drilling program at Red Mountain,
including: 14m @ 5.5 g/t Au incl 6m @ 12.3 g/t Au from surface (ASX Release dated 17 June
2020).
A second drill program is planned to commence in early July at the Company’s 100%-owned Split
Rocks Gold Project. As previously announced (ASX Release dated 14 February 2020), drilling
will test a series of high-order targets extending over 18km of strike throughout the project area.
Surface geochemical programs at the Company’s 100%-owned Flanagans Gold Project and at
the Develin Creek Copper-Zinc Project (both located in Queensland) have also commenced.
Canaccord Genuity (Australia) Limited acted as Lead Manager to the Placement.
