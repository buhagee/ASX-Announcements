deposition is clearly defined and predictable to the point where we will commence
immediate mining.
The Company is now underpinning the known potential of one of the highest grade global
mineral sands prospects by converting it into JORC compliant resources. We will be
stepping up our efforts to target additional resources that will further underpin the growth
of our newly granted mining operations at the Inland Strand at Tormin.”

Mineral Commodities Ltd (“MRC” or “the Company”) and its empowerment partner, Blue
Bantry Investments 255 (Pty) Ltd, are pleased to provide the latest update on drilling from
the newly granted Section 102 Amended Mining Right (“S102 Mining Right”) (WC
30/5/1/2/2/10108MR) and Prospecting Right (WC 30/5/1/1/2/10262PR) owned by the
Company’s 50% South African subsidiary, Mineral Sands Resources (Pty) Ltd (“MSR”).
The first phase of drilling at the Western Strandline has been completed with a total of
6,917 metres drilled, consisting of 311 holes for 5,995m. The drilling program targeted
resource definition at the newly granted expanded Mining Rights area and northern and
southern extensions of the Inland Strand, adjacent to the existing Tormin mining
operations in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
Significant results from the extensional drilling on the Western Strandline to the north of
the area in the newly granted S102 Mining Right include (all from surface):
•
•
•

Hole L27-4)
Hole L26-5)

The extensionial drilling indicates that the Western Strandline extends from the northern
to the southern boundary of the 12km prospecting area.
The Tormin Inland Strands Project
The Inland Strands are multiple palaeo strandlines running semi-parallel to the coastline
and within the Geelwal Karoo farm Inland Strand prospecting tenure. Two palaeo-marine
strandlines have been identified, which consist of a Western Strandline (35-40m above
mean sea-level), and an Eastern Strandline (86m above mean sea level). Aeromagnetic
data indicates that the Inland Strands run contiguously along the coastline of the
Company’s entire granted mining, prospecting and application tenure. The drilling
program targeted a geophysical aeromagnetic anomaly previously identified as a buried
palaeo-strandline by MSR in 2014.
The strandline is a concentration of high-grade Valuable Heavy Minerals2 (“VHM”) with
overburden horizons above the strandline in the form of Aeolian facies (orange
feldspathic sand), erosion surface facies (dorbank, silcrete, calcrete) and Red Aeolian
Sands deflation zones that have also been confirmed to be mineralised in places.
2-

VHM includes zircon, rutile, anatase, ilmenite, garnet and magnetite.

Resource Definition Drilling - S102 Mining Right area on the Western Strandline
The drilling program was concentrated on defining resources over the newly issued S102
Mining Right area which covers 5.5km of the identified 12km long Western Strandline, as
well as extensional drilling to the north and south of the S102 area. The resource drilling
program on the S102 area consisted of a total of 311 holes drilled for 5,995m containing
23 drill fence lines 250m apart on 20m spacings (254 holes) and 11 infill drill fence lines
on 25m spacing (57 holes) between the primary lines in the southern half of the Western
Strandline. The exploration holes drilled in fence lines are indicated in Figure 3 and over an
aeromagnetic map in Figure 4. All one-metre drillholes samples were dried, weighed, deslimed (removal of -45 micron fraction) and screened (+1mm oversize) before assay at
the Tormin laboratory by XRD machines (the Rietveld method after HLS) and at external
laboratories for QA/QC. With the resource definition program completed, the Company
expects to release a maiden JORC Indicated and Measured Resource on the Western
Strandline by the end of July 2020.

The north and south extensions of the Western Strandline
To test the northern extensions of the orebody, 12 holes were drilled between the
boundary of S102 Mining Right area to the northern boundary of the Prospecting Right. A
pair of holes, 20m apart, were drilled on the centre of 6 lines 500m apart, with all holes
intersecting mineralisation. Some of the thickest and highest grade intersections are
outlined below:
• Hole L28-6) 11m @ 50.8% THM from 34m, includes 7m @ 65.2% THM from 35m
• Hole L27-4) 5m @ 73.1% THM from 27m
• Hole L26-5) 14m @ 37.9% THM from 24m, includes 5m @ 68.6% THM from 33m
• Hole L25-6) 5m @ 61.4% THM from 33m
These initial drilling results indicate an exploration target area of additional high-grade
mineralisation to the north of the S102 area, which is approximately 2.5km long by 150 to
200m wide. The main mineralised horizon is flat, laying at an average depth of ~28m from
surface and between 5m to 14m thick (Figure 5).

Infill and Step Out Resource Definition
The Company intends to immediately commence a 10,000m drilling program designed to infill
the existing targeted resource areas and step out the resource along the extent of the known
mineralised zones. The additional drilling is planned at the north and south extensions of the
Western Strandline to complete fence line resource drilling as part of a strategy to unlock the
full potential of the Prospecting Right as quickly as possible.

Eastern Strandline
The Eastern Strandline is located at an average height of 86m above sea level and runs
semi-parallel to the Western Strandline. Recent analysis of aeromagnetic data and
historical drilling (non-JORC compliant) has identified the heavy mineral strandline and
the Company has prioritised follow-up exploration. A 2,000 metre aircore drilling program
has recently commenced at the Eastern Strandline targeting 9 lines of drilling spaced
1,000m apart (Figure 2 and 3). Exploration results are expected by the end of the
September quarter.
Aeromagnetic Survey
The Company has significant prospecting areas of Inland Strand Prospecting Right under
application. These prospecting tenures include large tracts of semi-continuous Inland
Strand exploration targets to the south of the Tormin Inland Strand Prospecting Permit,
known as the De Punt Prospecting Area, covering an area of approximately 13.4km in
length covering approximately 4,495 hectares. The area to the north of the current Tormin
Inland Strand Prospecting Permit, known as Klipvley Karoo Kop, covers an area
approximately 16km in length and covering approximately 3,970 hectares.
The significant results towards the northern and southern extents of the Tormin Prospecting
Right (Geelwal Karoo farm), have indicated high potential for adjoining prospecting areas,
which will be further explored using geophysics prior to drilling. MRC has engaged Xcalibur
Airborne Geophysics (“XAG”) to undertake a horizontal gradient fixed-wing airborne
magnetic and radiometric survey over the tenements, consisting of approximately 1,109 line
kilometres with 100m survey line spacing and 35m flying height above ground level. XAG will
commence the survey by mid-August subject to weather conditions; data processing and
anomaly maps will be delivered in the September quarter.

appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These
examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement
tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to
the Public Report. In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has
been done this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3kg was
pulverised to produce a 30g charge for fire assay’). In other cases
more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse
gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant
disclosure of detailed information.

operations on the Company-owned farm Geelwal Karoo 262.
• The general area has been investigated and mined for heavy
mineral deposits as far back as the 1930s (Haughton, 1931).
Subsequent geological surveys and exploration programs
investigated the distribution, mineralogy and economic potential
of the heavy mineral sands along the coastline of Geelwal Karoo
(Toerien & Groeneveld 1957, Abele 1989, Swart 1990, Barnes
1998) and Trans Hex 1989-1991).
• During 1999, Trans Hex conducted additional onshore
drilling of strandlines and identified the inland raised beach
deposits containing heavy minerals. Trans Hex subsequently
bulk sampled the material by digging several trenches in
1999-2000.

• Geology

• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.

• The heavy mineral sand deposits occur in a current active
beach environment (eg Tormin mine) as well as in older palaeobeach raised strandlines found inland (inland strandlines) eg.
Tronox Namakwa Sands.
• Apart from the mid-Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary
(Paleogene) sediments along the coast, numerous small
fossiliferous, marine and terrestrial deposits of Neogene age
outcrop along the coastal zone.
• The onshore mineral sands are marine paleo-terraces “Inland
Strands”, aeolian sands and fluvial sediments. These targets
were
formed
during

depth of drilling is 40.25 metres.
• East collar ranges – 220,486mE to 227,039mE
• North collar ranges – 6,501,154mN to 6,510,978mN
• Azimuth ranges/dip ranges – vertical drilling

• hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that
the information is not Material and this exclusion does not
detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent
Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
• Data
aggregation
methods

• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg
cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material
and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and
some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown
in detail.

• No weighting or cutting of HM values, other than averaging of
grades intersected were reported.
• As all samples are 1 metre in length, no length weighting is
required in averaging grades.

• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.
• Relationship
between
mineralisation
widths and
intercept
lengths

• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting
of Exploration Results.

• The strandline mineralisation is sub-horizon in nature and the
air core drilling intercepts are vertical.

• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.

• Thickness of intercept reported is therefore true thickness of
the mineralisation.

• Diagrams

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery
being reported these should include, but not be limited to a plan

• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported,
there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole
length, true width not known’).
• Maps, sections and plan view are provided in this report.

view of drillhole collar locations and appropriate sectional
views.
• Balanced
reporting

• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high
grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading
reporting of Exploration Results.

• Intersection with grades above 10% or above 5% VHM have
been reported in this release to indicate the high-grade
strandline zones.

• Other
substantive
exploration
data

• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test
results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.

• Historical drill data is not reported as it is classified as historical
foreign estimates that are non-JORC compliant.

• Further work

• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for
lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out
drilling).

• Further drilling is planned to produce an inferred/indicated
resource over the north extension of Western Strandline and an
inferred Resource over the Eastern Strandline.

• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions,
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling
areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.

• Measured and Indicated Resource of S102 Mining Right area
to be delivered in late July.
