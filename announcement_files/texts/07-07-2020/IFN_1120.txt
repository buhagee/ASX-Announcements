Target’s Statement) issued by Infigen Energy Limited (ABN 39 105 051 616) and Infigen
Energy RE Limited (ABN 61 113 813 997) in its capacity as responsible entity for the Infigen

Target’s Statement or the UAC First Supplementary Target’s Statement, this Second
Supplementary Target's Statement will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Update on the Revised Iberdrola Offer – satisfaction of the Iberdrola
FIRB Condition

On Tuesday, 7 July 2020, Iberdrola Australia provided to Infigen and released to the ASX a
notice given under subsection 630(4) of the Corporations Act declaring that the Iberdrola FIRB
Condition has been fulfilled.
The effect of this notice is that the Revised Iberdrola Offer is now:
(a)

free of the Iberdrola FIRB Condition; and

(b)

subject to only one Defeating Condition, being the Iberdrola Minimum Acceptance
Condition.

Infigen Security Holders should note that the Original Target’s Statement and the First
Supplementary Target’s Statement were dated and released to the ASX before Iberdrola
Australia provided the notice described above and, accordingly, each contains statements to
the effect that the Revised Iberdrola Offer is subject to the Iberdrola FIRB Condition, which are
now outdated (see, among other places, part 3 of section 1.2 of the Original Target’s Statement
and sections 4, 5 and 6 of the UAC First Supplementary Target’s Statement).

Infigen Directors’ recommendation

The Infigen Directors continue to unanimously recommend that Infigen Security Holders
REJECT the Revised UAC Offer. To REJECT the Revised UAC Offer, you should ignore any
documents sent to you by UAC and take no action in respect of the Revised UAC Offer.
The Infigen Directors’ reasons for recommending that Infigen Security Holders REJECT the
Revised UAC Offer are set out in section 4 of the UAC First Supplementary Target’s Statement,
and include that Infigen has received the Revised Iberdrola Offer, which:
(a)

offers $0.89 per Infigen Stapled Security, compared to $0.86 per Infigen Stapled
Security under the Revised UAC Offer; and

(b)

for the reasons set out in section 4.1 of the UAC First Supplementary Target’s
Statement, the Infigen Directors believe is superior to the Revised UAC Offer.

The Infigen Directors note that:
(a)

as described above, the Revised Iberdrola Offer is now subject to only one Defeating
Condition, being the Iberdrola Minimum Acceptance Condition; and

(b)

as stated in section 4.1 of the UAC First Supplementary Target’s Statement, the PreBid Agreement, in addition to the Infigen Directors’ decision to recommend the
Revised Iberdrola Offer, in the absence of a Superior Proposal, continues to provide
the Infigen Directors with a reasonable basis to consider that the Iberdrola Minimum
Acceptance Condition is likely to be satisfied during the Iberdrola Offer Period, unless
a Superior Proposal emerges.
