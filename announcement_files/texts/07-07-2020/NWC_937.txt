Highlights

DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS:

 Massive sulphides intersected in all six drill holes completed to date since drilling re‐
commenced at the high‐grade Antler Copper Project in Arizona, USA in early June:

Richard Hill
Chairman



Thick, high‐grade mineralisation continues to be delineated below historical
workings;



5.5m of massive‐ and semi‐massive‐sulphides intersected in the deepest hole drilled
at the Project to date, ~200m down‐dip from historical stopes;



Initial assay results expected in the coming weeks;



Drilling continues, with holes systematically evaluating deeper levels of the Deposit.

 Detailed magnetic surveying over the Antler Deposit completed:


The Antler Deposit coincides with a +1,000m long magnetic anomaly, most of which
remains poorly or completely untested by drilling;



A strong, adjacent, 400m‐long magnetic anomaly is interpreted to potentially arise
from the folded extension of the Antler Deposit.

 Ground EM survey currently in progress over the recently delineated magnetic anomalies.

New World Resources Limited (ASX: NWC; “the Company”, or “New World”) is pleased to advise that it continues to
make good progress on multiple fronts with exploration and development activities at the high‐grade Antler Copper
Deposit in Arizona, USA.
Drilling

For personal use only

Since drilling at the Project resumed in early June, a further six diamond holes have been completed (to date). Massive
sulphide mineralisation has been intersected in all six holes (see Figure 1 and Table 2).

Significantly, a 5.5m thick interval of semi‐ and massive‐sulphides was intersected in the deepest hole the Company
has drilled to date, ANTRCDD202009, which is located approximately 200m down‐dip of the historical stopes.

Significant mineralisation has also been intersected in several shallow holes – providing further evidence of the strong
potential to mine additional mineralisation in the upper levels, adjacent to historical stopes.

Mineralisation remains open both along strike and at depth. The Company is currently systematically drilling additional
holes at deeper levels as part of its program to delineate Indicated Resources that can be used for mining studies.
Initial assay results from the current drilling program are expected in the coming weeks.

historical underground workings, previous drilling and selected significant intersections in historical surface drilling. Areas being targeted in
the current phase of drilling and the current ground EM survey are illustrated.

Detailed Magnetic Survey

For personal use only

The magnetic iron‐sulphide mineral, pyrrhotite, has been observed to be intimately associated with the mineralisation
at the Antler Deposit. In light of this, the Company commissioned a detailed magnetic survey over the Deposit which
was completed recently to assist in delineating extensions of the mineralisation. A drone was used to acquire data on
50m‐spaced survey lines.
A strong magnetic anomaly, up to 200nT, coincides with the Antler Deposit (see Figure 2). Significantly, this anomaly
extends over a strike length of more than 1,000m. A substantial portion of the southern end of this anomaly is poorly
and/or completely untested with drilling, highlighting the outstanding potential to delineate extensions of the
mineralisation along this corridor.

A strong 400m‐long adjacent magnetic anomaly is also evident from the data immediately west of the 1,000m‐long
magnetic anomaly. Historical geological mapping indicates that the geological horizon that hosts the Antler Deposit
may be folded into this area. Minor sulphide mineralisation has also been intersected in the upper portions of several
previous holes that were drilled through this area on their way to test to the deeper levels of the Antler Deposit.

Based on this evidence, the 400m long anomaly is interpreted to potentially represent the folded extension of the
Antler Deposit. No drilling has ever been undertaken to specifically target this magnetic horizon.
Ground EM and IP surveying, together with magnetic modelling, is currently in progress to refine targets in advance of
focused drill testing (see below).

potential extensions of the mineralisation at the Deposit.

Ground EM and IP Surveying
A fixed‐loop electromagnetic (“EM”) survey is currently in progress over the two recently defined magnetic anomalies
described above.

For personal use only

An Induced Polarisation (“IP”) survey is also being planned over these areas.
Both EM and IP are well‐established geophysical techniques that can be used to delineate sulphide mineralisation.
Results from these surveys will be used to refine targets within the magnetic anomalies in advance of initial drill testing.

Metallurgical Testwork
Initial metallurgical testwork on a composite sample collected from the Company’s first six drill holes is progressing
well.
Separate primary rougher copper and zinc concentrates have already been produced. Assay results for this work is
being interpreted in advance of further tests that are scheduled to be undertaken this week.

Results and recommendations from this initial program are expected before month end. These initial metallurgical
studies will likely be complemented by testing additional samples recovered from the current drilling program.

APPENDIX 1
Antler Copper Deposit – Background

For personal use only

On 14 January 2020 New World announced it had executed an agreement that provides it the right to acquire a 100%
interest in the Antler Copper Deposit.

The Antler Deposit was discovered in north‐western Arizona, USA, in the late 1800s (see Figure 2).

Intermittent production from the Deposit between 1916 and 1970 totalled approximately 70,000 tonnes of ore at a
grade around 2.9% Cu, 6.9% Zn, 1.1% Pb, 31 g/t Ag and 0.3 g/t Au.
Ore was extracted over approximately 200m of strike from an inclined shaft, to a maximum depth of 150m. The
average thickness of ore was reported to be around 4 metres. Additional underground workings were developed to a
depth of 200m – but no production was recorded from the deeper levels (below 150m depth; see Figures 1 and 3).
Between 1970 and 1975, following completion of the most recent episode of mining, a total of 19 holes were drilled
from the surface and underground with the objectives being to:
(i)

Increase confidence in the known mineralisation immediately below the mined levels (predominantly
below the “7th Level” which was developed 150m below surface) in advance of anticipated resumption
of mining; and

(ii)

Explore for additional mineralisation.

Figure 2. Location of the Antler Copper Project in Arizona, USA.

Considerable high‐grade mineralisation was delineated with closely spaced drilling immediately below the historical
stopes, over about 150m of strike by 200m down‐dip (see Figures 1 and 3).

Significant intersections (in unmined mineralisation) included:


9.66m @ 3.57% Cu, 6.63% Zn, 0.82% Pb, 34.4 g/t Ag and 0.34 g/t Au (U30);



7.62m @ 2.80% Cu, 7.29% Zn, 1.61% Pb, 43.4 g/t Ag and 0.54 g/t Au (DDH12);



5.18m @ 2.90% Cu, 12.58% Zn, 2.08% Pb, 63.1 g/t Ag and 0.42 g/t Au (U16);

New World Resources Limited I ASX: NWC I Page 12



7.62m @ 2.47% Cu, 3.52% Zn, 2.81% Pb, 64.5 g/t Ag and 0.46 g/t Au (B‐3); and



6.40m @ 1.51% Cu, 10.69% Zn, 1.95% Pb, 52.1 g/t Ag and 0.29 g/t Au, and
5.55m @ 4.39% Cu, 6.34% Zn, 0.53% Pb, 20.6 g/t Ag and 0.56 g/t Au (both in U18).

For personal use only

Other, widely‐spaced drilling intersected additional high‐grade mineralisation both (i) at depth, considerably below
historical workings; and (ii) along strike from the historical workings.

Following completion of the last historical drilling, in 1975, a consultant to Standard Metals Corporation (the owner of
the Project at the time), prepared a preliminary feasibility study into the redevelopment of the Antler Deposit. This
included a mineral resource estimate, which comprised:

Readers are referred to the Company's initial market release dated 14 January 2020 which provides supporting information on the
historical resource estimate.
The Company confirms that the supporting information disclosed in the initial market announcement continue to apply and has not
materially changed.
Readers are cautioned that that this estimate is a "historical estimate" under ASX Listing Rule 5.12 and is not reported in accordance
with the JORC Code.
A Competent Person has not yet undertaken sufficient work to classify the historic estimate as mineral resources or ore reserves
in accordance with the JORC Code.
It is uncertain that, following evaluation and/or further exploration work, it will be possible to report this historical estimate as mineral
resources or ore reserves in accordance with the JORC Code.

Despite the presence of this sizeable and high‐grade resource, mining never resumed.

The detailed drilling, immediately below the 7th Level (150m depth; see Figure 3), indicates there is substantial high‐
grade mineralisation that may be rapidly extracted if mining operations resume. And the results from the deeper and
more widely‐spaced drilling, where high‐grades were returned in all but several holes, indicates there is considerable
potential to delineate additional, mineable, high‐grade mineralisation at the Project with further infill drilling.
The Company’s immediate objective is to delineate a JORC‐Code Indicated Resource that can be used in mining studies
to evaluate the potential to bring the Antler Deposit back into production in the near‐term.

Material to the Public Report.
 In cases where ‘industry
standard’ work has been
done, this would be relatively
simple
(e.g.
‘reverse
circulation drilling was used to
obtain 1 m samples from
which 3 kg was pulverised to
produce a 30 g charge for fire
assay’). In other cases, more
explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse
gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual
commodities
or
mineralisation types (e.g.
submarine nodules) may
warrant disclosure of detailed
information

Commentary
 Reverse circulation (RC) pre‐collars have
been drilled for deeper holes, before holes
were completed with diamond core drilling
through the targeted mineralised intervals.
Shallow holes have been drilled with
diamond core from surface.
 RC chip samples and HQ diamond core
samples have been obtained during drilling.
 RC chip samples were collected at 1.52m (5
foot) intervals; every interval is logged and
those containing notable mineralisation
and/or alteration are split and submitted to a
laboratory for analyses.
 Core is being logged and marked up for
sampling by experienced geologists.
Mineralised (and potentially mineralised)
intervals of core is then cut in half (with a core
saw), with half‐core retained on site for
further reference and the other half‐core
submitted to a laboratory for analysis.
 To date information provided is restricted to
visual analysis; no details of grade based on

if so, by what method, etc.).

Commentary
 For deeper holes, RC pre‐collars have been
drilled through the hangingwall at shallow
levels before holes are completed with
diamond core drilling through the targeted
mineralised intervals (these holes are named
ANTRCDD2020XX).
 For shorter/shallow holes, diamond core was
drilled from surface to the end of the hole
(these holes are named ANTDD2020XX).
 In all holes, HQ diamond core drilling was
undertaken through the targeted mineralised
horizon(s).

Recoveries were generally good.
There does not appear to be a relationship
between sample recovery and grade.
Recoveries were normal through the
mineralized zone.
It is too early to ascertain whether there is
any relationship between sample recovery
and grade as assay results are pending.

Commentary
 Drill core has been halved with a core saw;
with one half of the core sent to a laboratory
for assay and the other half retained on site
in ordered core storage trays for future
reference.
 Generally, the upper 60m of RC holes are dry
and therefore dry‐sampling of the 1.52 m
intervals is achievable. Below 60m depth, RC
chips were wet‐sampled. RC intervals
selected for assay sampling are split via riffle
splitter prior to submittal to a laboratory for
analyses.
 Blanks, duplicates and standards are included
