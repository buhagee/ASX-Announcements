Blackstone Purchases Third Diamond Drill Rig to Accelerate Drilling
at Ban Chang

Blackstone purchases a third diamond drill rig to accelerate drilling the Ban Chang prospect at
the Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE project in Vietnam (Refer to Figure 3);
Blackstone owns two diamond drill rigs drilling Ban Chang East and the King Cobra Discovery
zone (KCZ) at Ban Phuc;

A third diamond drill rig will allow Blackstone to accelerate drilling at Ban Chang to supplement
the ongoing study work focused on downstream processing to produce nickel sulfate for the
lithium-ion battery industry;

By purchasing a third diamond drill rig the Company has an “All-in” diamond drilling cost of
US$50/m at the Ta Khoa project, a ~60% reduction in drilling costs relative to Australian
industry averages i;

Blackstone’s four maiden drill holes at Ban Chang all intersected massive sulfide nickel over a
1.2km strike within a 1.2km long massive sulfide target zone defined by high priority
electromagnetic (EM) plates (Refer to Figure 1).

Blackstone Minerals’ Managing Director Scott Williamson commented:

“Blackstone has made rapid progress over the past few months and we are very excited about the potential
of Ban Chang. Our latest assays have confirmed a new zone of high-grade mineralisation which was
previously untested at Ban Chang East. As we work towards completing our scoping study this quarter, we
have now purchased an additional diamond drill rig to ensure we can progress the project as rapidly as
possible as we systematically test our 25 massive sulfide targets.”

Blackstone Minerals Limited (ASX code: BSX) is pleased to announce the acceleration of diamond drilling
at the Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE project in Vietnam with the purchase of a third diamond drill rig. This will
allow Blackstone to fast track drilling along strike and down-dip at the Ban Chang prospect (Refer to Figure
1), where the company has previously reported the following significant results (Refer to Figure 1):
BC20-01 5.2m @ 0.66% Ni, 0.73% Cu, 0.04% Co & 0.79g/t PGE1 from 58.0m

1.5m @ 2.20% Ni, 2.12% Cu, 0.13% Co & 2.66g/t PGE from 58.5m

ASX RELEASE

For personal use only

Blackstone has purchased a third diamond drill rig to accelerate drilling at the Ban Chang prospect as it
targets a further resource update as soon as possible after completion of the maiden Ban Phuc resource
this quarter. It will drill further targets later in 2020, extending the drilling program to beyond Ban Chang
and throughout the 25 massive sulfide vein (MSV) targets (Refer to Figure 2).

Successful deployment of Blackstone owned and operated drill rigs has to date provided the company with
substantial cost savings, with approximately 60% reduction of per metre drilling costs relative to
Australian industry averages. Owning and operating three diamond drill rigs substantially increases the
amount of drilling the Company can undertake relative to other companies for the same expenditure.
At the Ban Chang prospect, the Company currently has assays pending from hole BC20-02 which
intersected 1.2m MSV from 87.0m (Refer to Figure 1) and BC20-04 which intersected a 15.4m wide zone of
sulfide vein mineralisation (Refer to Figure 1). The drilling is part of an ongoing campaign to target regional
MSV as Blackstone aims to build its resource inventory at Ta Khoa to supplement the Ban Phuc maiden
resource, which is on track for completion in Q3, 2020.

2020) & BC20-04.

Ban Chang
The Ban Chang prospect is located 2.5km south-east of the processing facility and the Ban Phuc deposit
adjacent to the Chim Van – Co Muong fault system. The prospect geology consists of a tremolitic dyke
swarm within phyllites, sericite schists and quartzites of the Devonian Ban Cai Formation. The known
mineralization style is mainly veins and lenses of massive sulfide as well as disseminated sulfide (DSS)
hosted within tremolite dykes. The dyke swarm is approximately 900 m long, and varies between 5m and
60m wide. The dykes and massive sulfide are interpreted to be hosted within a splay (and subsidiary
structures) off the major regional Chim Van – Co Muong fault system.

Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE Project – Next Steps

Blackstone Minerals aims to deliver a maiden resource in Q3, focused initially on the DSS at Ban Phuc and
continues to investigate the potential to restart the existing Ban Phuc concentrator through focused
exploration on both massive sulfide veins (MSV) and DSS deposits. Blackstone Minerals has commenced
a scoping study on the downstream processing facility at Ta Khoa. The scoping study, also to be
announced in Q3, will provide details for joint venture partners to formalise the next stage of investment.
Blackstone Minerals has commenced metallurgical testing on the Ban Phuc DSS deposit with an aim to
develop a flow sheet for a product suitable for the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition, Blackstone
Minerals will investigate the potential to develop downstream processing infrastructure in Vietnam to
produce a downstream nickel and cobalt product to supply Asia’s growing lithium-ion battery industry.

Figure 3: Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE – Project Location

The Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE Project in northern Vietnam includes an existing modern nickel mine which
has been under care and maintenance since 2016 due to falling nickel prices. Existing infrastructure
includes an internationally designed 450ktpa processing plant. Previous project owners focused mining
and exploration efforts primarily on the MSV at Ban Phuc. Blackstone Minerals plans to explore both MSV
and DSS targets throughout the project, initially within a 5km radius of the existing processing facility.
Blackstone Minerals will conduct further geophysics on the MSV and DSS targets and continue its maiden
drilling campaign. Online readers can click here for footage taken from our Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE
Project.
