Tomingley Gold Operations Meets FY2020 Guidance
Tomingley Gold Operations has met FY2020 guidance, which was upgraded after
the September 2019 quarter.
FY2020 gold production was 33,507 oz (guidance 30,000 oz to 35,000 oz).
FY2020 preliminary AISC was $1379/oz (guidance $1,250/oz to $1,400/oz).
Group unaudited cash, bullion and listed investments position at 30 June 2020
totalled A$98.4M.
The updated Tomingley Gold Operations mine plan is undergoing final review
and approval and will be released along with FY2021 guidance.
Alkane Resources Ltd (‘Alkane’ or ‘the Company’) (ASX: ALK) is pleased to announce its
Tomingley Gold Operations in central west New South Wales have met its FY2020
production guidance of between 30,000 oz to 35,000 oz.
The Operations produced 33,507 oz of gold for the 12 months to 30 June 2020 with
preliminary all in sustaining costs (AISC) of $1357/oz produced, which fell within cost
guidance ($1,250/oz to $1,400/oz) for the same period. The strong 12 month
performance at Tomingley has coincided with a 25 per cent appreciation in the gold
price and the Company’s progress towards a demerger of Australian Strategic Materials
Limited (ASM) to become a separate ASX listing, allowing Alkane to focus exclusively on
its gold projects.
The Group’s unaudited cash, bullion and listed investments position at 30 June 2020
totalled A$98.4M, comprising $66.9M cash, $5.8M of bullion in hand and $25.7M of
listed investments.
Alkane Managing Director, Nic Earner, said: “The team at Tomingley Gold Operations
continues to perform very well, consistently meeting or exceeding guidance. With an
updated mine plan soon to be released and the great potential being shown very close
to the mine, through our exploration at Roswell and San Antonio, we remain buoyant
about the longer-term prospects at Tomingley. The Board and management
acknowledge and thank the team at Tomingley for their strong and continued safety and
production performance.”

ABOUT ALKANE ‐ www.alkane.com.au ‐ ASX: ALK
Alkane is a gold production company with a multi‐commodity
exploration and development portfolio. Alkane’s projects are
predominantly in the Central West region of NSW, but extend
throughout Australia through investments in other gold
exploration and mining companies.
Alkane’s gold production is from the Tomingley Gold
Operations (TGO) which has been operating since early 2014
and it’s most advanced gold exploration projects are in the
100% Alkane owned tenement area between TGO and Peak
Hill and have the potential for sourcing additional ore for TGO.
Alkane has other 100% owned exploration tenements in the
Central West NSW prospective for gold and copper. The
recently announced significant porphyry gold-copper
mineralisation intersected at Boda is an example of this
potential.
Alkane’s largest non‐gold project is the Dubbo Project (DP), a
large in-ground resource of zirconium, hafnium, niobium,
yttrium and rare earth elements. It is a potential strategic and
independent supply of critical minerals for a range of
sustainable technologies and future industries. The DP is
development ready, subject to financing, with the mineral
deposit and surrounding land acquired and all major State and
Federal approvals in place. The DP is part of Alkane subsidiary
Australian Strategic Materials, which will demerge with Alkane
subject to shareholder approval.
