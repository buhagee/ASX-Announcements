TRADING UPDATE, CAPITAL RAISING AND CO-FOUNDER
SELL-DOWN1
Afterpay Limited (​Afterpay or the Company​) is pleased to provide a trading update for the
three month period ended 30 June 2020 (Q4 FY20) and the financial year ended 30 June 2020
(FY20). Afterpay also announces a capital raising of approximately $800m that includes a fully
underwritten institutional Placement to raise $650m, followed by a non-underwritten Share
Purchase Plan that aims to raise approximately $150m.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS
●

Strong performance across the business has delivered underlying sales of $11.1b in FY20,
more than doubling the prior corresponding period (pcp) (up 112%).

●

Underlying sales in Q4 FY20 was $3.8b, 127% above Q4 FY19.

●

Q4 FY20 sales performance represented the highest quarterly performance ever, reflecting
the accelerating shift to e-commerce spending since the impacts of COVID-19 emerged
globally.

●

Merchant revenue margins for FY20 are expected to be in line with or better than H1 FY20
and FY19.

●

Net Transaction Loss (NTL) for FY20 ​is expected to be up to 55 basis points. ANZ NTL has
remained at historically low levels and NTL within the US and UK regions has improved in
2H FY20 compared to 1H FY20 as a result of improving risk performance and historically
high payment recovery rates.

●

Net Transaction Margin (NTM) for FY20 is expected to be approximately 2%, underpinning
a pathway to longer term profitability for the overall business.

​All financial results shown in this announcement for the financial year ended 30 June 2020 (FY20) are unaudited

Key active customer milestones were achieved in both the US and the UK in June 2020,
with the US reaching 5.6m and the UK 1m active customers. Strong new customer
acquisition saw the company exceed its target of 9.5m active customers by the end of
FY20.

●

Active merchants4 reached 55.4k in FY20, 72% above FY19, driven by strong merchant

by a Share Purchase Plan, that is not underwritten, to raise approximately $150m.

●

Afterpay is raising additional capital to accelerate its investment in growing underlying

the longer term. This includes:

○

Creating the flexibility and capacity to execute on potential M&A opportunities that
could present themselves in the short to medium term.

Significant items include expenses related to one-off items, share-based payments and foreign currency gains or
losses which are still being finalised. In FY20, foreign currency gains may be higher than prior periods due to
favourable foreign exchange rate movements in the period.

NOTE: CHANGE CALCULATIONS MAY NOT EQUATE DUE TO ROUNDING.

●

Strong performance across the business delivered underlying sales of $11.1b in FY20,
more than double pcp.

●

FY20 underlying sales in ANZ, our most mature market, delivered strong growth (up 52%
on FY19). Online sales increased by 46% in FY20 compared to FY19, while in-store
volumes grew by 81%. In-store sales growth remained strong for FY20 despite COVID-19
related impacts in H2 FY20.

●

The US continued to grow underlying sales substantially (up 330% on pcp), driven by the
introduction of new global enterprise retailers to the platform and an acceleration of
e-commerce spending.

●

Strong sales growth in the UK was positively impacted by a growing retailer base. Active
merchants in Q4 FY20 increased by 74% compared to Q3 FY20.

●

Record global performance in Q4 FY20 led to a 48% increase in global underlying sales on
Q3 FY20. This reflects the increase in online spending, various government stimulus
initiatives introduced in each region and the attractiveness of our budget-focused model in
the current environment.

●

All regions performed well in Q4 FY20 with sales in the UK 62% higher, US 62% higher and
ANZ 38% higher than Q3 FY20.

●

Contribution of underlying sales from the developing US and UK markets increased to 47%
in Q4 FY20 compared to 43% in Q3 FY20.

3. CUSTOMERS AND MERCHANTS
●

Growth in global active customers to 9.9m has seen the company exceed its target of 9.5m
active customers by the end of FY20.

●

Afterpay added an average of 20.5k new customers to its platform per day in Q4 FY20, an
acceleration on the Q3 FY20 rate of 15.1k per day.

●

Customer engagement remained strong with 91% of global underlying sales coming from
repeat purchasers during Q4 FY20.

●

In FY20 there was a shift to debit card usage by customers globally with 87% of customers
in ANZ, 89% in the US and 96% in the UK now using debit cards on Afterpay.

●

Sustained growth in ANZ customer base continues to be driven by the expansion into new
verticals, including eBay, which launched in April.

●

Strong active customer growth in the US resulted in a 219% increase on pcp. Having
reached over 5m customers, in only two years, further validates our ability to scale quickly
in a much larger and deeper market.

●

Exceeding 1m customers in the UK, within only 12 months, is a testament to our maturing
brand and differentiated business model in that region.

●

Customer frequency has improved across all regions. In FY20 the earliest customer cohorts
in ANZ are now, on average, transacting 25 times per annum (up from 23 times in H1
FY20).

●

Global average order value was $153 for FY20.

●

Over 23k new merchants have transacted on the platform in FY20 with a number of new
global enterprise retailers going live in FY20.

●

The number of small to medium sized retailers (SMBs) joining the platform accelerated in
Q4. ​In ​June 2020, underlying sales from SMB merchants providing Afterpay in-store, was
up 92% year on year, demonstrating that customers are continuing to support smaller and
local retailers through the COVID-19 period​.

NEW MERCHANTS
Key merchants that went live or contracted during Q4 FY20:
●

ANZ ​– Aesop, Swarovski, KitchenAid Australia, Repco, Riot Stores, Drummond Golf, Catch

EBAY AUSTRALIA
●

The launch of eBay in Australia has driven strong customer acquisition and a more
diversified customer profile.

●

Hundreds of new customers join Afterpay through eBay each day, the majority of which are
male and are older than Afterpay's average customer.

●

Since launch, top categories have included vehicle parts and accessories, home and
garden, and electronics (including computers and tablets).

QANTAS FREQUENT FLYER
●

Afterpay and Qantas Frequent Flyer have announced an exclusive partnership that allows
members to earn Qantas Points through the Afterpay platform.

●

Qantas Frequent Flyers can earn up to 5,000 Qantas Points on purchases made through
the Afterpay platform when they link their membership to their Afterpay account.

4. GLOBAL EXPANSION
NEW MARKETS
●

Planning for expansion into Canada has progressed with launch expected in Q1 FY21.

●

As part of the company’s strategic planning process, opportunities to accelerate our
expansion into additional markets have been identified. This has the potential to see us
launch into new markets in late 2020 or early 2021.

●

The Company is exploring a number of small M&A opportunities to accelerate roll out
across potential new international markets. Due diligence is being undertaken, however,
there is no certainty that any deal will be completed.

US IN-STORE
●

US in-store is expected to launch in Q1 FY21 with our merchant launch partners. With over
5m active customers already on the Afterpay platform in the US, we expect our in-store
offering to be well received by customers who are accustomed to using Afterpay online.

5. INNOVATION
●

Product innovations implemented in Q4 FY20 included:
○

Ability for consumers to make overdue payments at checkout which improves the
recovery of late payments and enables them to continue purchasing with Afterpay

6

For personal use only

●

○

Flexibility of payments by allowing customers to nominate any amount to be paid
against an order to help manage their budgets;

○

Ability for customers to request a change to payment schedules to align with pay
days, or help in managing finances; and

○

“Afterpay for Good” program which allows customers to “top up” purchases and
donate to important causes - currently COVID-19-relief funds.

Customer account limit transparency
○

●

●

●

●

Viewing spending limits is one of the top 3 features requested by customers as it
assists with budgeting and planning of purchases with Afterpay. It will be available in
all regions through the Afterpay app and Afterpay account online in Q1 FY21.

New repayment options
○

Apple Pay was made available as a repayment option for customers in all markets in
the beginning of June. This provides customers with greater flexibility in how they
manage their payments.

○

AMEX is now accepted as a payment option in the US with plans to add AU and UK
by the end of the calendar year.

Visa (US) and Mastercard (AU)
○

Commenced issuing activity with both Visa and MasterCard to accelerate merchant
integration in the US and AU, respectively.

○

Realised processing cost benefits from strategic agreements with both Visa and
Mastercard.

XBT
○

UK has been added to Afterpay's existing Cross-Border Trade (XBT) network in AU
and NZ. Customers will progressively have access to this service over the coming
months.

○

Adding future markets to the network is in the planning phase.

Express Checkout
○

Express Checkout functionality is expected to be introduced in Q1 FY21.

○

This allows customers to view their shipping and payment information in one screen
to make checkout faster and more efficient, in addition to increasing conversion.

6. REGULATORY UPDATE
AUSTRAC
●

AUSTRAC is still considering the Independent Auditor’s report, and Afterpay continues to
fully cooperate with AUSTRAC.

7

For personal use only

BNPL CODE OF PRACTICE
●

The public consultation process for the BNPL Code of Practice has now closed. An industry
working group, led by AFIA, is reviewing feedback and continuing engagement with ASIC.

●

Afterpay remains strongly supportive of the Code.

RBA SURCHARGING REVIEW
●

In late 2019 the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced a review of retail payments
regulation in Australia, including whether BNPL providers should be allowed to prevent
merchants from surcharging customers who use BNPL schemes.

●

Afterpay made submissions to the RBA as to why it should not be regulated as a payment
system. The RBA has since announced that its review is on hold, and completion of the
review is not expected until 2021.

GOVERNMENT POLICY UPDATE
●

Afterpay continues to welcome Government support measures for consumers and
businesses throughout the COVID-19 period.

US REGULATORY MODEL
●

Afterpay has recently changed the legal structure of its business model in the US market,
which has involved the need for some State-based licences. There has been no material
business interruption to the overall US operation.

7. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT UPDATE
●

Since the Business Update released on 14 April 2020, Afterpay has completed a number of
capital management initiatives which optimise the Company’s cost of funding and increases
total funding capacity and duration:
○

Repayment of the $50m Australian Corporate Bond, resulting in cash interest savings
of approximately $3.6m per annum on an annualised basis.

○

Increase of NZ receivables warehouse facility from NZ$20m to NZ$50m to fund NZ
receivables, with Bank of New Zealand. This facility has been extended to March
2022.

○

Extension of the US$200m receivables warehouse facility with Citi to May 2022, to
fund US receivables.

○

Afterpay has also received terms for the establishment of a GBP100m facility to fund
UK receivables with an existing global banking partner. This new facility is subject to
entry into formal documentation and final diligence and approvals.

8

For personal use only

●

Afterpay does not have any debt facilities maturing within the next 12 months and has
increased its weighted average life of facilities to approximately 2 years through the
initiatives outlined above.

●

These enhancements are enabled by the continued strong repayment profile of Afterpay’s
receivables in each of its regions.

8. CAPITAL RAISING TO FURTHER ACCELERATE GROWTH
Afterpay has continued on its growth trajectory in FY20 and Q4 FY20. Since the impacts from
COVID-19 began, we have seen consumers:
○

Shift further towards online spending

○

Increase their focus on budgeting

○

Develop a greater aversion to traditional credit products

This compounding behavioural change organically increases the attractiveness of Afterpay’s
purposefully differentiated model.
Achieving $11.1b of underlying sales in FY20 demonstrates that the Company is well positioned
to exceed our underlying sales target of $20b by the end of FY22.
Afterpay is raising additional capital to accelerate its investment in growing underlying sales,
and prioritising global expansion in the short term to maximise shareholder value in the longer
term. This includes:
○

Investing in our existing regions to maintain and grow our leading position in each
market and expand our customer offerings;

○

Expediting our expansion into new markets to increase our relevance on a global scale
and meet the needs of our valuable global retailers;

○

Fortifying our balance sheet to underpin funding of our rapid growth in underlying sales
in excess of our FY22 mid-term targets; and

○

Creating the flexibility and capacity to execute on potential M&A opportunities that could
present themselves in the short to medium term.

Our updated global expansion roadmap will see us launch in Canada in Q1 FY21, and has the
potential to see us launch into new markets in late 2020 or early 2021. As part of this plan, we
are exploring a number of small M&A opportunities to accelerate roll out across potential new
international markets. Due diligence is being undertaken, however, there is no certainty that any
deal will be completed.

Afterpay CEO Anthony Eisen commented:
“Today’s announcement is the outcome of a lot of hard work and unwavering commitment by a
world class team. Our ability to achieve such positive operating metrics in the current

9

For personal use only

environment, is a product of our purposefully differentiated business model and our loyal
customer and retailer base.
“Given the ongoing impacts from COVID-19 and the uncertain global economic conditions, we
have continued to focus on preserving capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
“The flexibility in our business model allowed us to manage risk when we needed to, but also
take advantage of positive customer sentiment and behaviours. Our ongoing investment in
growing our retailer and customer bases, and global expansion objectives, will ensure we
continue to deliver long term benefits to our shareholders.
“By raising capital today, we believe we will be in the strongest position possible to execute on
our strategic initiatives and growth aspirations.

CAPITAL RAISING DETAILS

FULLY UNDERWRITTEN INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENT
Afterpay is undertaking a fully underwritten institutional Placement (Placement) to raise $650m.
Pricing will be determined via an institutional bookbuild, with an underwritten floor price of
$61.75 per new share (New Share). The underwritten floor price represents a 9.2% discount to
the closing price on 6 July 2020.
Final pricing and allocation decisions will be determined on behalf of Afterpay by an
independent sub-committee of its Board in consultation with the joint lead managers and
financial adviser. It is intended that eligible shareholders, who bid for up to their ‘pro-rata’ share
of New Shares under the Placement, at the final price, will be allocated their full bid, on a best
endeavours basis.
For the remaining shares under the Placement, Afterpay will seek to prioritise allocations to
existing shareholders and then introduce new shareholders, in each case based on factors
including likelihood of long term support, the strategic alignment of the investor, support to date
and the size and timeliness of bids into the book. New Shares issued under the Placement will
rank equally with Afterpay’s existing shares.
No shareholder approval is required for the Placement, as the Company will utilise a portion of
its existing placement capacity under ASX Listing Rule 7.1.
Afterpay’s shares will remain in a trading halt today while the Placement is conducted. Normal
trading in Afterpay shares is expected to resume on 8 July 2020 or such other time as the
completion of the Placement is announced to the market.

CO-FOUNDER SELL-DOWN
Concurrent with the Placement, Afterpay co-founders, Anthony Eisen and Nicholas Molnar have
each agreed to sell 2.05m shares, representing 10% of their respective holdings in Afterpay
(Co-founder Sell-down). The Co-founder Sell-down represents approximately 1.5% of total
shares outstanding in Afterpay.

10

For personal use only

The Co-founder Sell-down will be fully underwritten with pricing determined under the bookbuild
for the institutional Placement.
Mr. Eisen and Mr. Molnar are each expected to remain Afterpay’s largest shareholders (subject
to allocation of New Shares under the Placement and the Co-founder Sell-down) with a relevant
interest in approximately 18.4m shares each. Mr. Eisen and Mr. Molnar remain committed to
Afterpay and have each confirmed that they will not sell any further shares until after the
Company’s 2020 AGM.

SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
A share purchase plan (SPP) will follow the Placement with eligible Afterpay shareholders in
Australia and New Zealand offered the opportunity to acquire additional shares in Afterpay. The
SPP will not be underwritten.
Shareholders on the Afterpay register at 7:00pm (Sydney time) on 6 July 2020 (Record date),
with a registered address in Australia or New Zealand will be entitled to subscribe for up to
$20,000 worth of Afterpay shares through the SPP, subject to eligibility criteria and other terms
and conditions of the SPP which will be set out in the SPP booklet and despatched to eligible
shareholders in due course. Shares issued under the SPP will rank equally with existing shares
of Afterpay.
The SPP aims to raise approximately $150m. Afterpay may decide to scale-back applications
under the SPP at its absolute discretion. New Shares under the SPP are to be issued at the
lower of the price paid by investors under the Placement, and the 5-day VWAP of Afterpay
shares up to the SPP closing date.

ADVISERS
Highbury Partnership Pty Limited is acting as financial adviser to Afterpay; Baker McKenzie is
acting as legal adviser.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Further details about the Placement are set out in the investor presentation which has also been
provided to the ASX today. The investor presentation contains important information including
key risks and foreign selling restrictions with respect to the Placement.
Nothing in this announcement constitutes investment, legal, tax or other advice. You should
