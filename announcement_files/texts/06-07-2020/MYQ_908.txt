MyFiziq Limited (ASX: MYQ) (MyFiziq) would like to update shareholders with the progress and designs
of the new and soon to be released CompleteHealth application with Canadian based NuraLogix
Corporation.
As outlined to the ASX on the 15th June 2020, MyFiziq signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
with Canadian base Nuralogix Corporations. Under the MoU, MyFiziq will be designing and developing the
integrated offering, with a view to initially release it to only 2 organisations for testing and evaluation.
MyFiziq has had an influx of inquiries from Telehealth, Wellness, Pharmacy Chains, Diabetes managements
organisations, Insurers, and Re-Insurers, so much so, the companies have agreed to make the application
available to a greater number of these organisations than previously anticipated.
The non-invasive combined solution delivers complete privacy to the consumer, which culminates in the
individual being given assessments on multiple levels, such as;
Blood pressure.
Stress levels.
Heart rate.
Heart rate variability.
Irregular heartbeat.
Respiratory rates.
Emotion.
Total body fat.
Waist to height ratio.
Waist to hip ratio.
Cardiovascular disease risk.
Type 2 diabetes risk, and
Stroke risk.
The resulting captures and data are allowing an individual the opportunity to understand their personal
exposure to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and respiratory disease that form up to 70% of
deaths globally each year, not including the current pandemic. All publications and research have been
published on NuraLogix website.i

Furthermore, we will allow an option for an individual to engage in an in-app COVID-19 symptoms analysis,
which has been developed and tested by NuraLogix in collaboration with St. Michael’s Hospital, University
of Toronto, and Zhongda Hospital in China to produce an AI based model which was trained and tested on
the symptom’s profiles of COVID-19 patients. The model predicts the likelihood of someone having
COVID-19 versus seasonal flu or cold.

“The team has done an exceptional job designing the new application, which will be called CompleteHealth.
I am extremely pleased with the amount of interest this has generated from our initial ASX release. This
validates our initial thoughts on the value we will bring to communities by combining these solutions.
Importantly, we are identifying several chronic disease markers the have severe implications, should the user
be exposed to COVID-19. The comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, respiratory disease and
cardiovascular disease that are identify through the process are important information for the user to consider
upon the evaluation being completed.”
