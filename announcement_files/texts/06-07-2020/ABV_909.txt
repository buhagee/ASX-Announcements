Advanced Braking Technology Limited (ASX: ABV) (‘ABT’ or ‘the Company’) is pleased to provide an
operational update that demonstrates the business continues to perform strongly despite the broader
economic conditions.
COVID-19
ABT reiterates its previous communication to shareholders on 30 April 2020 whereby business operations
continue to function effectively and service levels are being maintained.
The Company’s primary customer base remains within the mining and civil construction industries which
to-date continue to operate during this challenging period.
At present, our supply chain continues to function as per our business requirements. Current travel
restrictions are not adversely impacting supply and delivery of products, which has ensured the continuity
of business operations, without compromising the supply of products to our customers, both here in
Australia and internationally. ABT is continually reviewing our customer activity and supply chain and will
amend its business operations as required to reflect any change in the operating environment.
The Company has benefited from the financial assistance measures provided by both the Federal and
Western Australian governments, to help protect both the business and its employees and will seek to
utilise additional government assistance should it become eligible. During FY20, the Company received
approximately $0.1 million in financial assistance.
Revenues
The Company was impacted by a temporary deferral of sales orders during April and May, however strong
sales in June has resulted in total operating sales for Q4 FY20 of $2.1 million (unaudited).
This unaudited result represents:
- a 11% increase over the prior Q3 FY20 period;
- a 5% increase over the corresponding Q4 FY19 period; and
- a 30% increase over the corresponding Q4 FY18 period.

Total Operating Sales of $6.85 million.

For personal use only

Subject to year-end adjustments and the external audit, the Company is expecting an improved full year
FY20 financial result on the 1H FY20 reported net loss of $0.006 million (FY19: Net Loss of $1.71 million).

ABT CEO, Mr John Annand stated, “the Company has worked hard to increase sales during this challenging
period and has benefited from the diversification strategy implemented during FY20 whereby our products
are sold to an expanding customer and industry base. Whilst these results are positive, the Company will
continue to monitor the broader economic environment and amend its business operations as required.
It is satisfying to report to shareholders the expected improvement in the financial result for FY20 over
FY19. This is the outcome of over 12 months of strengthening the business and sets the foundations for
continued growth through the ongoing implementation of the Company’s strategy.”
