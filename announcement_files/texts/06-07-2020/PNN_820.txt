Priority Nickel-Copper Targets at
Musgrave Project
PepinNini Lithium Ltd (ASX: PNN) (PepinNini, the Company) is pleased
to announce that it is reviewing and intending further investigation of
multiple priority exploration targets at its 100%-owned Musgrave NickelCopper Sulphide Project in South Australia.
The targets are located at the Mt Caroline tenement area (Granted
Exploration Licence - EL6148, formerly EL5220), which covers a total
area of 1,918km2 in the central Musgrave district (Figure 1).
EL6148 covers the central and southern parts of the large
(approximately 20km2) Mt Caroline layered mafic-ultramafic intrusion,
known as the Giles Complex Formation, and its potential feeder
structures.
PepinNini has identified four key anomalies at Mt Caroline, defined from
the results of a detailed, 400 metre line-spaced, airborne
electromagnetic survey (AEM) flown with the SkyTEM516 system (PNN
ASX release: 19 December 2016).
The four anomalies were identified from their magnetic response and
geological and structural setting (Rankin, 2002), as well as their
proximity to regolith copper anomalism returned from previous shallow
vacuum drilling conducted by PepinNini (PNN ASX release:18 June
2014).
The highest priority target is the Fowler Anomaly, which partly coincides
with a strongly remanent magnetic anomaly (Figure 4 left).
The Fowler Anomaly has a distinct negative (remanent) magnetic
response, similar to the 100% PNN owned Mt Harcus Intrusion within
the Giles Complex in the Musgrave Province (Copper 0.3% to 0.7%,
Nickel 0.3%, Cobalt 0.1% PNN ASX announcement 30 April 2008). The
Giles Complex is known to host Nickel-Copper in places and can be
coincident with the late-time conductivity anomaly seen in the AEM data.
This very promising Fowler Anomaly (Figures 2-3) is also located in a
favourable structural setting and is interpreted to have similar features
(chonolith feeder-dyke) to the mineralisation style of the major NeboBabel Nickel-Copper Project (Probable Ore Reserve of 220Mt @ 0.36%
Copper and 0.33% Nickel: announced ASX:OZL and CZI 12 February
2020) in the western Musgrave Province.
Based on the favourable geological and structural setting of the Fowler
Anomaly, PepinNini plans to undertake a targeted detailed ground EM
survey, followed by shallow vacuum drilling in its next phase of
exploration at the Musgrave Project.

This field work will be designed to identify and define magmatic sulphide mineralisation within this
increasingly important area of the Musgrave Geological Province.
PepinNini Managing Director Rebecca Holland-Kennedy said:

For personal use only

“PepinNini is actively reviewing and prioritising its portfolio of projects with a view to advancing core
projects and to deliver shareholder value. The Musgrave Project area holds significant potential across
multiple target areas and, following a review of previous studies, a number of highly promising targets have
been identified.”

Fowler Anomaly – Southern Dune Field Area

Figure 1: AEM Anomalies at PepinNini’s Musgrave Project

Exploration Approach
The central, southern and eastern portions of the Mt Caroline licence area (EL 6148 formerly EL 5220)
include the Southern Dunes Fields and Central Plains prospects and were subject to a broad regional
TEMPEST AEM survey in 2016.
Five areas of interest were defined from this regional electromagnetic data, airborne magnetic
interpretations and geological observations and these were selected for a detailed follow-up ‘infill’ AEM
survey at a 400m line-spacing, using the SkyTEM516 system.
The electromagnetic technique used was Time-Domain electromagnetic survey (TDEM) which is
considered to be the best tool for the detection of massive nickel copper sulphides.
The five follow-up infill AEM target areas identified four late-time anomalies in the Southern Dune Fields
area that were selected due to their strong magnetic responses and geological and structural setting
(Rankin, 2002). In addition to reinforce the potential for mineralisation, these targets are located proximal to
an area of weak regolith copper anomalism (at the Central Plains area) which was identified from previous
shallow vacuum drilling completed by PepinNini (PNN ASX release:18 June 2014).
The Fowler Anomaly (Southern Dune Fields) contained the largest amplitude late-time response from the
results of the AEM, which partly coincides with a strongly remanent magnetic anomaly (Figure 4 left).

The strong late-time conductivity feature at the Fowler Anomaly is located at the junction between east west and southwest - northeast paleochannels. This may provide a possible explanation for the localised
high-amplitude response. The data from the closer-spaced AEM survey clearly defines a pattern of
extensive shallow flat lying paleodrainage responses over the area of interest (Figure 4, right).

component Channel 35)

Figure 3: Chonolith Model of Fowler target from magnetic data by James Austin, CSIRO; Looking north (left) and
Looking down (right).

These paleochannels are likely to be structurally controlled and reflect a bedrock architecture which may
also impact the geometry of the negatively magnetised (intrusive) body. The stronger paleochannel
response could potentially indicate the preferential weathering of a mafic intrusive body (potentially the
Giles Complex) within resistant Pitjantjatjara Supersuite basement.
This Fowler Anomaly is therefore highly recommended for follow-up investigations using detailed ground
EM and shallow vacuum drilling. The potential here is that magmatic sulphide accumulations may be
masked by the paleochannel EM response.

clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be
stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some
typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.

Modern exploration across the Musgrave Province has included regional
airborne magnetics-radiometrics, airborne electromagnetics, ground
gravity surveying, ground magnetics, ground IP, ground EM, magnetic lag
sampling, rock chip sampling, soil sampling, RC drilling and diamond
drilling.
The detailed PNN AEM geophysical surveys are located in areas where
no previous exploration activities have been undertaken.
PepinNini is primarily exploring for massive magmatic Ni-Cu-Co sulphide
& PGE systems related to mafic intrusions of the 1070Ma Giles Event,
polymetalic Broken Hill Style associated with the Birksgate Complex
metamorphic basement and precious metals within listric shear structures
within the basement architecture.
The targeted prospects contain structural and magnetic features and

Relationship between
mineralisation widths and
intercept lengths



These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported,
there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole
length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.



Not applicable. - no sample results reported



Regional location map of PNN tenure and survey outline are provided in
Figure 1
Tenement and prospect scale maps showing the location of activities are
provided as Figure 5.

Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results;
bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics;
potential deleterious or contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
