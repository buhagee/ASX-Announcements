Initial
Target
Markets

AngelMed Guardian® market penetration can be achieved by leveraging pacemaker surgery know-how and existing infrastructure:
Efficacy / Risks

▪ Provides a diagnostic alert tool that is needed but not currently available

Addressable market

▪ Larger addressable market when compared to pacemaker / ICDs (est. 2x-3x)

Technical maturity:

▪ Pacemaker device implant risks are well known & accepted, & pacemaker lead surgical implant procedures well-practiced

Economics:

▪ USA pricing USD$9k+. Pricing lower than double chamber pacemaker & ICDs. For 50%+ patients, the device cost is expected to be
covered by private health insurance. Government medical device & surgical reimbursement schemes applications are underway
▪ Process underway to identify sub-distributors in markets including Japan
