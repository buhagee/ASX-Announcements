Background
Located 40km north of Kalgoorlie

Until 2018 a series of small projects
Largely unexplored with sub-economic

Background (cont.)
An area needing consolidation
o

o

Tenement areas were too small for effective exploration
and/or successful project development;
Separate ownership hindered value creation

Consolidation
o

o

Aphrodite deposit acquired via the merger with Aphrodite
Gold in 2017
Excelsior and Zoroastrian deposits acquired via merger
with Excelsior Gold in 2018
Plus

Low-cost, complementary acquisitions
o
o

o

Acquired 40 tenements from Torian Resources, May 2019
Purchase of Vettersburg tenement (Aug 2019) –
opportunity to explore for extensions to historical Slug Hill
gold mine (production of 26,535t at 23.5g/t Au for
20,008oz)
Acquisition of Mayday North and North Kanowna Star in
September 2019

Exploration Target: The potential quantities and grades are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to date to define a Mineral Resource. It is not certain that further exploration
will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource under JORC 2012. Full details on the Exploration target are contained in the ASX announcement dated 25th February 2020

Competent Person’s Statement
Competent Person’s Statement – Exploration Results/Target
Information in this announcement that relates to exploration results and exploration targets is based on information compiled by Mr. Bradley Toms who is the Exploration Manager of
Bardoc Gold Limited. Mr. Toms is a Member of The Australian Institute of Geoscientists and has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under
consideration and to the activity that he is undertaking, to qualify as Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the “Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral
Resources and Ore Reserves”. Mr. Toms consents to the inclusion in the document of the information in the form and context in which it appears.
Exploration Target¹: The potential quantities and grades are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to date to define a Mineral Resource. It is not certain that
further exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource under the “Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, the JORC
Code” (JORC 2012). The Exploration Target is not being reported as part of any Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve. Full details on the Exploration target are contained in the ASX
announcement dated 25th February 2020 – “Further Drilling Success at Mayday North as Wide Gold Hits Confirm Strong Potential for Resource Growth”.

Competent Person’s Statements – Mineral Resources
The Company confirms it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the 30 September 2019 Bardoc Resource Estimate and that all
material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimate continue to apply and have not materially changed when referring to its resource announcement made on 30
September 2019.
Competent Person’s Statements – Ore Reserves – Open Pit & Underground

The information referred to in this announcement has been extracted from the Pre-Feasibility Report and Ore Reserve Statement dated 17 March 2020 and available to view on
www.bardocgold.com.au. The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the Ore Reserves Statement and
that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the Ore Reserves Statement continue to apply and have not materially changed. The Company
confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Person’s findings are presented have not been materially modified from Ore Reserves Statement.
