Dear Ivan
Kleos Space S.A. (“KSS”) REQUEST FOR TRADING HALT
Kleos Space S.A. (the Company), requests two consecutive back-to-back trading halts be applied to
its fully paid ordinary securities with effect from the commencement of trading on Monday 6 July
2020, pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 17.1. The trading halt is requested for the purposes of considering
and executing a capital raising.
The following information is provided in accordance with Listing Rule 17.1:
1. Commencement of trading halt: The Company requests that the consecutive back-to-back
trading halt commence with effect from commencement of trading on Monday 6 July 2020.
2. Reasons for trading halt: The Company is considering a significant issue of securities for
purposes of a capital raising. Information about the issue (including the price at which a
potential placement would be undertaken), may have a material effect on the price or value
of the Company’s securities. The capital raising and book building process is scheduled to
take place over the course of four trading days, to allow for the planning and execution of a
capital raising with international elements.
3. Duration of trading halt: The Company expects the trading halt to last until it makes an
announcement to ASX concerning the capital raising, which the Company anticipates will be
made prior to commencement of trading on Friday 10 July 2020.
4. Termination of the trading halt: The trading halt will terminate no later than the
commencement of trading on Friday 10 July 2020.
The Company is not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be granted.
If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely
