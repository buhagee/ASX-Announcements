Acquisition of Brisbane Airport Link Service Centre
APN Convenience Retail REIT (AQR or the Fund) is pleased to announce that it has agreed to acquire
Brisbane Airport Link Service Centre, QLD for $10.5 million, representing a purchase yield of 6.15%.
Brisbane Airport Link Service Centre occupies a prime position as the last eastbound travel centre heading
to the Gateway Motorway, which is exposed to over 100,000 vehicles daily and accessible to over 50,000
cars a day heading to Brisbane Airport and the Gateway Motorway.
The newly built service centre is anchored by a 15 year lease to Ampol (currently branded as Caltex and its
Foodary convenience store) which represents 78% of the centre’s income, with the remainder of the income
derived from Zarraffa’s Coffee and a local restaurant operator, Ahmet’s.
AQR Fund Manager, Chris Brockett said: “We are thrilled with the acquisition of Brisbane Airport Link
Service Centre. This acquisition represents an outstanding opportunity to own a prominent service centre
where all tenancies benefit from visual exposure as well as introducing another major fuel tenant, Ampol, to
the Fund’s tenancy mix. The site is strategically located in a precinct that will service high volumes of diesel
sales given the density of industrial holdings within the immediate area, and its proximity to courier, taxi, and
car rental services stemming from Brisbane Airport.
With a WALE of 12.6 years and annual rental increases of between 2.0% and 3.5%, the property will provide
a long term, secure and growing income stream for the Fund.”
Following settlement of Brisbane Airport Link Service Centre, which is expected to occur before the end of
August 2020, AQR’s portfolio will comprise 80 properties valued at approximately $455 million. This would
reflect a weighted average capitalisation rate of 6.6% and a portfolio WALE of 10.7 years. The acquisition
will be funded from existing debt capacity, taking AQR’s gearing to 17% or 21% on a pro forma basis1
(adjusted for the remaining fund through development pipeline).
This announcement was authorised to be given to the ASX by Joseph De Rango, Chief Financial Officer.
