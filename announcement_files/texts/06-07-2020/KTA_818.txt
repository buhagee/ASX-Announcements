KTA Acquires Historic High Grade Gold Mines &
Substantial Acreage Expansion in the Lachlan Fold Belt


Application made for the Rand Project, covering a substantial area of 580km2 in the Central
Lachlan Fold Belt, NSW



Rand Project is prospective for multi million-ounce mineralisation-styles, including shearhosted and intrusion-related gold systems like De Grey's Mallina Gold Project



The Project covers a 40km structural corridor that transects mineralised Silurian and
Devonian granite and Ordovician sediments, which are masked by colluvium



The Project captures the Bulgandra Goldfield which comprises several shallow mines which
historically produced gold at very high grades (up to 265g/t gold or 8.53oz per ton)



Rock and mullock samples across limited outcrop returned significant results including:

9.60g/t gold, 31g/t silver (Welcome Find Reef)
6.90g/t gold (Show Day Reef)
6.50g/t gold (Show Day Reef)
4.13g/t gold (Goombargana Hill)



Several holes from a 1988 shallow RC drill campaign ended in gold mineralisation preserved
near the base of an intensively weathered and leached saprolite at the Welcome Find Reef
and Show Day Reef with no subsequent exploration work.



The Company continues its strategy of value accretive acquisitions within the Lachlan Fold
Belt, focused on gold +/- copper

Krakatoa Resources Limited (ASX: KTA) ("Krakatoa" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has
considerably expanded its landholding in the Lachlan Fold Belt through direct license application. The
100%-owned Rand Project includes four contiguous exploration licence applications (ELA5982, ELA5985
ELA6012 and ELA6013), covering a combined area of 580km2, located approximately 60km NNW of
Albury in southern NSW. The historical Bulgandra Goldfield, which is captured by the Project,
demonstrates the project area is prospective for shear-hosted and intrusion-hosted gold. Historical
production records show substantial gold grades, including 512oz from 60 tons and 70oz from 74 tons,
was respectively won from the exposed quartz veins in the Show Day and Welcome Find reefs at
Bulgandra.
The Company believes the gold occurrences at Rand fit within the classification of significant gold deposits
known as Intrusion-related gold systems (IRGS). Granite or sediment-hosted sheeted veins and
stockworks like those already identified at Bulgandra are considered characteristic of IRGS systems.

Whilst the Company is not aware of any reason why the exploration licence for the Rand Project will not
be granted in due course (anticipated within three to six months), investors are cautioned that there is a
risk this may not occur.
Project Background
Gold was discovered at Bulgandra in 1894, with the peak of activity occurring in 1895 and 1896. Further
production happened in the period between 1932-35, where mining was extended to depths of 30 metres
and grades were very rich, up to 265g/t. Historical mining widths are poorly documented. However, a 2.6m
wide lode was exploited at the Welcome Find reef. The total recorded gold production, from incomplete
records, was 76.45 kg (2,458 ounces). High royalty demands from private landowners saw many mines
abandoned by 1901 with all production in the camp ceasing during the drought of 1902. Table 1
summarises the reported production from the main historical workings present in the Bulgandra camp.

The known workings occur on small windows of deeply weathered and extensively leached bedrock in the
variably thick blanket of recent sediments (Figure 1). Past exploration has concentrated on the areas of
outcrop and was limited to the Show Day and Welcome Find Reefs. The Lone Hand and Goodwood Reefs
have not been explored since their original closure pre-1902.
Geology
Ordovician-aged sediments of the Abercrombie Formation, including feldspathic-micaceous sandstone
interbedded with laminated siltstone and mudstone, dominate the geology at Rand. The Abercrombie
Formation is intruded by the Silurian Goombargana granite predominantly in the south and Devonian
Jindera granite in the east of the Project (Figure 1). Felsic volcanics of the Devonian Wallandoon ignimbrite
lie along the Project's northern boundary. Several apophyses of the Goombargana granite crop out within
the project area, which is mostly dissected by faulting. Much of the Paleozoic geology is deeply weathered
and obscured by Tertiary to Recent sediments up to 50m thick.
The Project lies in the Tabberabbera Zone of the Central Lachlan Fold Belt between two regional shear
systems, the NW-trending Kancoona shear zone (located near Coreen) in the west and the north-trending
Kiewa shear zone to the east. A SW-trending shear zone transects the entire tenement package linking
the two regional shears. The shear zone bifurcates into several subordinate splays forming a distinct
structural corridor some 40 km in length (Figure 2). The subsidiary shears develop a distinctive pattern
(similar to a diffraction array in appearance) upon exiting the Goombargana granite in the west, which
supports a westward propagation. The Goombargana granite failed brittlely promoting a north-block
westerly shear sense. The Abercrombie Formation sediments in contact with the Goombargana granite
also fail progressively resulting in an anastomosing interlocking network of shear zones.
The shears, north of Mullemblah Hill in the Project’s east, interact and partially wrap the Jindera granite
intrusion.

Mineralisation
Gold mineralisation in the Central Lachlan is spatially related to the granitoid bodies, their contact aureoles
and associated regional structures. For example, tin and gold mineralisation occur within veins related to
main northeast-striking faults in the Goombargana Hill granite. The Goombargana Hill granite margin is
considered a prime target area for Krakatoa. Further gold mineralisation was also most likely introduced
with the emplacement of the I-type Jindera granite during the Tabberanean Orogeny1. Therefore, Rand is
prospective for the intrusion-related gold (IRG) deposits. However, more work is required to unequivocally
link the mineralised systems to the predictive IRGS model present at Rand.
More specifically, gold mineralisation in the Bulgandry Goldfield is hosted in quartz lodes in a regionally
persistent shear zone. The shear-hosted mineralisation is best exemplified by the high-grade Show Day
Reef group of workings which directly lie over an interpreted primary shear (Figure 2). The gold at
Bulgandra resides in narrow, sheeted quartz veins and stockworks within the Abercrombie Formation.
Alteration associated with the veins is weakly expressed as a narrow centimetre-scale selvage, and
observations support visible gold in quartz veins exposed in and around the historical workings. Mines
Department records indicate that some workings contain evidence of intrusive dykes and felsites.

Historical exploration
Bulgandra Goldfield
Transit Mining Pty Ltd explored the Welcome Find and Show Day Reefs between 1985 to 1989. Transit
collected fourteen rock chip samples during geological mapping (Annexure 1). The samples returned
strongly anomalous results in Au (including 9.6ppm, 6.9ppm and 6.5ppm), Ag (to 31ppm), As (to
2410ppm), Bi (to 40ppm), and Pb (to 5100ppm) (Elliot, 1986). Granite outcrop was identified within 50m
of the Show Day Reef, and a road cutting 800m from the same mine also produced anomalous gold,
supporting near-term exploration upside.
In late 1988, Transit developed 17 short inclined reverse circulation holes for approxiamately 525m drilled
(Annexure 1). The program included six holes at the Welcome Find Reef and eleven holes at the Show
Day Reef at an average depth of approximately 30m per hole, with a maximum depth of 39m. All holes
terminated in the deeply weathered and leached upper regolith: a zone where gold is commonly depleted
or leached altogether. Encouragingly, several drill holes terminated in mineralisation and/or display
anomalous gold towards the end of hole. The results include:




HB10 - 9m @ 0.41g/t Au from 21m to EOH
HB19 – 1m @ 1.23g/t Au from 28m
HB4 – 6m @ 0.28g/t Au from 24m to EOH

For personal use only

These results confirm gold is being leached from within the upper saprolite and indicate that satisfactory
drilling depths were not achieved. No subsequent exploration work was conducted. The Company
considers the Bulgandra Goldfield as largely untested.
Goombargana Hill
Goombargana Hill is a prominent granite body that rises over 200m above the surrounding plains. Limited
exploration work has been completed across the area, with reconnaissance sampling of quartz veining
within the Goombargana Hill granite by Cullen Resources in 2005, (EL6235), returning 4.13ppm Au and
0.28ppm Au with anomalous Ag, As, Bi, Mo, Pb, and Sb. Cullen considered no further work and withdrew
from the farm-in after their partner failed to meet their obligations.
Next steps
The Company will undertake a comprehensive review of the historical work completed and publicly
available datasets to generate targets for field reconnaissance.

ABOUT KRAKATOA:

For personal use only

Krakatoa is an ASX listed public Company predominately focused on gold exploration in the world class Lachlan Fold
Belt, NSW across three projects: Belgravia, Turon and Rand.

Belgravia Project (100%):
The Belgravia Project covers an area of 80km 2 and is located in the central part of the Molong Volcanic Belt (MVB),
East Lachlan province, between Newcrest Mining's Cadia Operations and Alkane Resources Boda Discovery. The
Project has six initial target areas considered highly prospective for porphyry Cu-Au and associated skarn Cu-Au,
with Bell Valley and Sugarloaf representing the two most advanced target areas. Bell Valley contains a considerable
portion of the Copper Hill Intrusive Complex, the interpreted porphyry complex which hosts the Copper Hill deposit
(890koz Au & 310kt Cu) and has highly prospective magnetic low features spanning 6km. Sugarloaf contains a 900m
Deep Ground Penetrating Radar anomaly located within a distinctive magnetic low feature considered characteristic
of a porphyry-style deposit and co-incident with anomalous rock chips including 5.19g/t Au and 1.73% Cu.
Turon Project (100%):
The Turon Project covers 120km2 and is located within the Lachlan Fold Belt's Hill End Trough, a north-trending
elongated pull-apart basin containing sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Silurian and Devonian age. The Project
contains two separate north-trending reef systems, the Quartz Ridge and Box Ridge, comprising shafts, adits and
drifts that strike over 1.6km and 2.4km respectively. Both reef systems have demonstrated high grade gold
anomalism (up to 1,535g/t Au in rock chips) and shallow gold targets (up to 10m @ 1.64g/t Au from surface to end
of hole) that warrant detailed investigation.
Rand Project (100% - application)
The Rand Project covers an area of 580km 2, located approximately 60km NNW of Albury in southern NSW. The
Project has a SW-trending shear zone that transects the entire tenement package forming a distinct structural corridor
some 40 km in length. The historical Bulgandra Goldfield, which is captured by the Project, demonstrates the project
area is prospective for shear-hosted and intrusion-hosted gold. Historical production records show substantial gold
grades, including up to 265g/t Au from the exposed quartz veins in the Show Day Reef.

JORC Code explanation

Commentary

 Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific
specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as
limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the
appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the
Public Report.
 In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be
relatively simple (eg' reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m
samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire
assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where
there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual
commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant
disclosure of detailed information.

 Reverse circulation drilling (Warman Iniversal 650 multipurpose) and
chip sampling at Bulgandra was completed by Transit Mining Pty Ltd
in 1988. Their work was restricted to the historical workings that they
could access, namely the Welcome Find and Show Day Reefs. Cullen
Resources completed chip sampling during reconnaissance of
Goombargana Hill exploring for intrusion-related gold and tin
deposits.
 The drilling was completed almost 30 years ago
 Each inclined hole (Annexure 1) was developed to an average depth
of 30 metres and sampled throughout its development length as
individual metre samples. Samples were split to ~1kg weight and
submitted to SGS Labs in Sydney.
 QA/QC procedures unknown.
 Drilling issues were encountered due to the deep and highly
weathered nature of the bedrock.
 Chip samples by Transit tested mullock where available (as most had
been removed for road base) and vein material where encountered
during mapping
 Chip samples were collected at a reconnaissance level
 After the failure of (triple tube) diamond drilling to provide meaningful
material for geological assessment, Transit switched to RC
 Both blade and limited hammer was employed by the RC contractor

 Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast,
auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard
tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core
is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
 Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and
results assessed.
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative
nature of the samples.
 Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and
whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of
fine/coarse material.

9

 Not documented (holes developed in 1988)
 Drilling issues were encountered due to the deep and highly
weathered nature of the bedrock which forced the switch from initial
diamond to RC drilling with a further change down from hammer
(repeated blocked bits) to blade
 All holes terminated in the deeply weathered and leached upper
regolith: a zone where gold is commonly depleted or leached
altogether

preparation technique.
 Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise
representivity of samples.
 Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ
material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/secondhalf sampling.
 Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being
sampled.
 The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory
procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.
 For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the
parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and
model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.
 Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks,

accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.
 The verification of significant intersections by either independent or
alternative company personnel.
 The use of twinned holes.
 Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification,
data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.
 Discuss any adjustment to assay data.
 Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and downhole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral
Resource estimation.
 Specification of the grid system used.

 All holes were quantitatively geologically logged and sampled as they

 Standard procedures were adopted for all Transit samples: dried, jaw
and roll crushed, split and pulverized in a chrome steel mill
 Fire Assay gold only analysis: 50g charge

 Any verification of significant intersections have not been qualified
 Drilling was on 10 or 20 line spacing
 Importantly, none of the drilling is considered deep enough to test the
mineralisation beneath the leached horizon
 No adjustments have been made to the assay data
 The work was for exploration not resource estimation
 Collar locations require field validation

 Quality and adequacy of topographic control.
 Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
 Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the
degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral
Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications
applied.
 Whether sample compositing has been applied.
 Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible
structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit
type.
 If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key
mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this
should be assessed and reported if material.
 The measures taken to ensure sample security.
 The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.

Drill hole
Information

 A summary of all information material to the understanding of the
exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all
Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of
the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
 If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the

 Past explorers completed RC drilling and limited chip sampling.
Krakatoa has reviewed this work and has some concerns over its
effectiveness, as large number of holes terminated in the leached
upper saprolite and failed to test the target at a satisfactory depth, i.e.
beneath the depletion zone.
 Cullens sampling attests to the prospectivity of the Goombargana Hill
area for IRGS.
 The Rand Project is located in the Central Lachlan Fold Belt in NSW.
The fold belt contains a sequence of Ordovician-Silurian aged back-arc
sediments (Abercrombie Formation) intruded by significant volumes
of granite and granodiorite, e.g Goombergana and Jindera Granites
 The fold belt is noted as host to important intrusion-releated tintungsten and prospective for gold mineralisation under the same
model
 Gold is thus spatially related to the granite bodies, their contact
aureoles and associated regional structures
 Seventeen inclined RC holes developed by Transit MiningPty Ltd in
1988
 All holes targeted to intersect reef systems within the leached upper
saprolite zone
 Collar locations, dip, azimuth and hole depths, along with the key
intersections, are provided in Annexure 1 of the report
 Three unsuccessfully developed diamond drill holes were not
discussed in the report. Their failure led Transit to switch to RC drilling
and are not material to the report.

Commentary

understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain
why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum
and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off
grades are usually Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results
and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such
aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should
be clearly stated.
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration
Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is
known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should
be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not
known').
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts
should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and
appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should
be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey
results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions
or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the
main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this
information is not commercially sensitive.

 No weightings applied

 All holes terminated in the deeply weathered and leached upper
regolith: a zone where gold is commonly depleted or leached
altogether
 Any relationship is difficult to determine because of the highly
oxidised and leached nature of the sampled materials

 The pertinent maps for this stage of Project are included in the
release.
 Co-ordinates in MGA94Z55
 All data is reported as presented in the historical records

 The Company is reviewing other potential datasets to assist
exploration in the Rand area.

 The Company will geological map and systematically sample the
environment, including accessing the underground workings
 On grant of tenure, the Company will prepare to drill several of the
targets outlined in this release
