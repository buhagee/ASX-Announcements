ASX/MEDIA RELEASE

AERIS UNDERTAKES A$ GOLD HEDGING FOR CRACOW

Established Australian copper and gold producer and explorer, Aeris Resources
Limited (“Aeris” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that its subsidiary, Lion
Mining Pty Ltd, has entered into unsecured A$ gold hedges with Macquarie Bank
Limited for 36,000 ounces at a forward price of A$2,536.25 per ounce. The hedges
will mature over the next 12 months in scheduled monthly deliveries of 3,000
ounces.
Aeris Resources Executive Chairman, Andre Labuschagne, commented:
“Given our commitments in the next 12 months to funding exploration activities
and debt repayments, we believe it was prudent to put these hedges in place to
underpin a portion of our operating cashflows whilst still providing exposure to
future upside in the A$ gold price. These hedges represent approximately 50% of
our targeted gold production from the Cracow Gold Operations in FY2021 and
have been strongly supported by our major shareholders and financier.”

This announcement is authorised for lodgement by:
Andre Labuschagne
Executive Chairman
