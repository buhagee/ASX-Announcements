PRELIMINARY DRILLING LOGISTICS AND SOIL SAMPLING COMPLETED
IN AREAS NEAR BROKEN HILL, NSW
Base Metals and Cobalt Exploration in ELs 8745, 8746 and 8747
Drilling to Test a 1.5 km Cobalt Gold and Base Metal Exploration Target in EL 8747
Ausmon Resources Limited (“Company”) is pleased to announce that the field exploration
work, announced on 15 June 2020, at ELs 8745, 8746 and 8747 (Figure 1) near
Broken Hill NSW has been completed.
To test an indicative 1.5 km cobalt, gold and base metals target within EL 8747, 10 sites
have been confirmed for RC drill holes (SVRC001 to SVRC010). The drilling will test the
PI2 pyrite/silica zone at 50 m below the surface and the cobaltiferous orthogneiss at 50
and 100 m below the surface. Application for approval of those sites is being lodged with
the Department of Primary Industries with a plan to commence drilling early next month
with drilling contractors under selection.
Several areas were selected for soil sampling based on the results of analysis and
studies of all available historical data and surficial exploration completed by the
Company since the grant of those ELs in May 2018.
286 soil samples within EL 8745 at exploration area Kambarra (KAS 090 to KAS375) and
44 soil samples within EL 8747 at exploration area Stirling Vale (SVS192 to 235) have
been collected. In addition, 19 rock samples have been collected, 16 from North
Kambarra and 3 from Stirling Vale.

The soil samples were collected along North-South oriented lines with samples
collected every 50 m along the lines. T h e s o i l s a m p l e s w e r e s i e v e d t o - 1 8 0
microns and analysed with the Company-owned Olympus Vanta pXRF.
Those soils samples are presently stored in paper geochemistry bags at the Company’s
Broken Hill storage facility. Following a review of the pXRF results, samples will be
selected for geochemical multi-element analyses at the ALS laboratory. In addition, 3
samples from core hole DD95STV3 (ASX Announcements: 17/07/2018 and 15/06/2020)
have been collected and will be despatched for petrological analyses.
The rock samples have been despatched to ALS laboratory in Orange for gold and multielement geochemical analyses.

EL 8747 – Stirling Vale
The primary aim of the field work was to establish the drill sites with collar and siter grid pegs
and determine access requirements for the RC drilling. A total of 10 drill sites have been
established (Figures 2 and 3) with 2 targeting the PI2 zone and 8 targeting the garnetiferous
zone drill tested by Pasminco, the previous operator, in 1995. The surface trace of all drill
holes was geologically mapped in the field and three 3 rock samples of the garnetiferous
were collected for gold and multi-element geochemical analyses. In addition, 44 soil samples
were collected to the south east of the drill collars in an area comprising amphibolite and

garnet amphibolite. The soil samples were scanned with the Company’s pXRF unit. The core
hole DD95STV3 was re-examined at the Mines Department Core Facility and 3 core samples
have been collected for petrological analyses. An announcement will be made when all
geochemical results have been finalized.

This licence is located 30 km south east of Broken Hill with more extensive recent
cover than the other Broken Hill licences. Figure 4 shows the mapped regolith
geology. Erosional/outcrop areas are primarily confined to the NE of the
tenement. The thickness of cover sediments is generally <2 m at Long Tank (KA3)
and Sampson’s Dam (KA2) and can be up to 40 m thick at Nth Kambarra (KA3).

Grid base soil sampling was completed at all three prospects with 286 samples collected
as 50 m intervals along north-south soil lines. The target at KA1 is a small gossanous
zone shown in Figure 4 as a small red polygon to the SW of the KA1 label. KA2
comprises sub crop of psammite, pelite which are locally garnetiferous. In addition, local
float comprising gossanous metasediment and quartz was located. The outcrop
expression at KA3 comprises strike extensive banded pyritic chert and pelitic
metasediments. In addition to the soil sampling at KA3, 16 rock samples of the pyritic
banded chert were collected for gold and multi-element geochemical analyses.

A single day field trip was conducted in the southern half of the tenement as a follow up to
the initial exploration completed in the north of the tenement in 2019 (ASX Announcement:
16/05/2019). Outcrop and subcrop was extensive with local thin transported cover to <2 m.
The geology comprised quartzo feldspathic gneiss, pelites and pegmatite. No significant
alteration, veining or mineralisation was noted.
