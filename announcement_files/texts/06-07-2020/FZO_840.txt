The Company will update the market on growth in annual recurring revenue in the upcoming June
2020 quarterly activities update.

Consumer growth continues
As announced in the Company’s March Quarter 4C operations report the Company has now
suspended its wholesale telco channel. This decision was made balancing concerns around the
potential impact of COVID-19 on our developing-world telco partners and the immediate growth
opportunities in education.
Notwithstanding, the Company’s, direct premium consumer accounts have continued to grow,
recently passing through 16,000 accounts. Freemium Insights accounts have also recently passed
through 70,000.
The Company plans to launch consumer offerings into the USA later this calendar year.
