ASX RELEASE: 6 July 2020

Drilling to recommence at the High Grade Kookynie Gold Project

HIGHLIGHTS
●

Drilling is set to re-commence at the high-grade Kookynie Gold Project in WA (which includes the
historic Cosmopolitan mine which produced 360,000oz at a very high average head grade of 15
grams per tonne (g/t)).

●

This follows outstanding results received to date from the June 2020 Phase 1 drilling programme,
where 21 out of 29 drill holes returned so far have delivered material grade intercepts (15 drill holes
still pending) including:
o LPRC0012 – 4m @ 16.3g/t Au from 42 metres,
▪ inc. 3m @ 20.7g/t Au from 42 metres1
o LPRC0015 – 9m @ 5.7g/t Au from 35 metres,
▪ inc. 2m @ 17.9g/t Au from 40 metres1
o LPRC0013 – 4m @ 13/g/t Au from 33 metres1
o LPRC0032 – 10 metres @ 3.21 g/t Au from 26 metres2
o LPRC0003 – 6 metres @ 9.4 g/t Au from 26metres,
▪ inc. 2metres @ 19g/t Au from 26metres3
Initial focus area of the new drilling programme will be at Leipold where the southernmost hole of
the Phase 1 programme returned 10 metres at 3.21 g/t Au from 26 metres. This extends known
mineralisation at Leipold to a total of 0.5kms. It is also in an area where 2.2kms of additional strike,
north and south of Leipold, remain relatively untested.

●

●

The new drilling programme, currently planned for an additional 5,000 metres, will likely be
increased following receipt of the final 15 drill-hole assays from the Phase 1 programme and the
receipt of the magnetic interpretations from the recently completed drone survey.

●

All the Company’s work to date is contributing towards being able to potentially convert the
significant Exploration Target (refer below) to JORC 2012 compliant mineral resource estimates.

●

Metalicity is well funded to execute this programme expeditiously.

Metalicity Limited (ASX: MCT) (“MCT” or “Company”) is pleased to announce that, based on the results
to date of the Phase One drilling programme, the Company is moving to recommence a significantly
expanded drilling programme at the Kookynie Gold Project4 (“Kookynie”). The return of significant
intercepts from the June 2020 Phase One drilling programme has continued to confirm mineralisation
within and extensions of previously developed and drilled areas for the Leipold Prospect. The second
phase is planned to commence in mid-July incorporating the results and targeting the extents of Leipold,
with further drilling designed to target McTavish, Cosmopolitan, Champion and Altona.

The Kookynie Gold Project is located 60 kilometres south south-east from Leonora, Western Australia and
is host to seven, significant prospects; Champion, McTavish, Leipold, Diamantina, Cosmopolitan and
Cumberland. Diamantina, Cosmopolitan and Cumberland are known collectively as the DCC Trend (see
Figure 1) and the Altona Trend. The historic Cosmopolitan mine which produced 360,000oz at a very high
average head grade of 15 grams per tonne (g/t).

For personal use only

Metalicity has also defined a significant “Exploration Target” of between 294,000 ounces and 967,000
ounces and is inclusive of historically stated mineral resource estimates and previously excluded areas of
underground development (please refer to ASX Announcement “Kookynie Gold Project – Development
Strategy & Exploration Target Update” dated 12 March 2020)
“Exploration Target” cautionary statement: The potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature,
given that there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and that it is
uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource.
All the work to date by Metalicity and its partner Nex Metals has been designed to work towards
producing JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource Estimates (which will potentially include previous JORC
2004 resources). The aim is also to establish a solid understanding of the mineralised extensions of all of
the Prospects which are open in all directions.
Overall, the exploration upside for the Kookynie Gold Project outside of the known Prospects is
phenomenal with 8 kilometres of strike extensions that have had relatively little to no work historically.
Commenting on the planned drilling, Metalicity Managing Director, Jason Livingstone said:
“The results to date from all our drilling programmes have been a delight to present. We have confirmed
mineralisation and are addressing aspects of JORC 2012 compliancy, but most importantly, we continue
to highlight that these prospects remain open in all directions through our step out drilling.”
“The Second Phase Drilling Programme is a major step forward for the Kookynie Gold Project. We intend
to continue our work methodically and expeditiously to illustrate the potential of the Kookynie Gold
Project. Through this expanded programme of approximately 5,000 metres of RC with a possible
component of diamond drilling initially targeting the southern extents of Leipold after the incredible 10
metres @ 3.21 g/t Au from LPRC0032, we will move quickly to fold in the pending results from McTavish
and the greater project from the drone magnetic survey. Whilst the Leipold Prospect has also returned
fantastic, high grade results like 4 metres @16.3 g/t Au, 9 metres @ 5.7 g/t Au, 6 metres at 9.4 g/t Au etc.
This result from the southernmost drill hole indicates we are far from the edge of mineralisation we are
observing at Leipold, let alone along strike, but down dip.”
“Finally, the Company is well placed financially to execute this programme and potentially expand it
further depending on the target generation exercises that may generate further targets from our drone
magnetic survey. It is truly an exciting time as we apply our learnings through methodical exploration and
development at the Kookynie Gold Project.”

Planned Drilling Programmes:
The planned programme at the Kookynie Gold Project (Figure 1) is designed to follow up on the
phenomenal drill-hole results to date through further step out and infill drilling. The Phase Two expanded
drilling programme will initially concentrate on the southern extents of Leipold (see Figure 2), but also
include, pending drone magnetic survey results and further assays, the circa 2 kilometre gap between
Leipold and McTavish, the extensions of McTavish, but also aspects at Champion, Cosmopolitan, and the
Altona area. The tenement E40/289, immediately east and along strike from the Orient Well mine site
was also surveyed using the drone. This data will be processed accordingly to generate drill targets which
dependent on the interpretations, may form part of the expanded programme. However, the expanded
programme will initially concentrate within the 8 kilometres of strike we have identified within the
Kookynie Gold Project around the Leipold, McTavish, Champion, DCC and Altona Trends.

The Leipold Prospect
The Company has previously confirmed and stepped out from the mineralisation, this expanded
programme of up to 5,000 metres of RC will initially target the southern strike extent and dip aspects of
the Leipold Prospect. The Company is continually updating aspects of the JORC 2004 Mineral Resource
Estimate of 555kt @ 1.9 g/t for 33koz (please refer to ASX Announcement by NME dated 1 August 2011
“Update on activities”) to potentially re-estimate and significantly refine the mineralisation model to JORC
2012 guidelines.

methodical, results driven approach to the exploration of the Prospects we have performed before.

Leipold and McTavish Prospects, with the DCC, Champion and Altona being assessed in due course through this
Phase Two Drilling Programme

Forward Looking Statements
This announcement may contain certain “forward-looking statements” which may not have been based solely on historical facts, but rather may
be based on the Company’s current expectations about future events and results. Where the Company expresses or implies an expectation or
belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have reasonable basis. However, forwardlooking statements:
(a) are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject
to significant technical, business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies;

6

For personal use only

(b) involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from estimated or anticipated
events or results reflected in such forward-looking statements. Such risks include, without limitation, resource risk, metals price volatility,
currency fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, as well as
political and operational risks in the countries and states in which the Company operates or supplies or sells product to, and governmental
regulation and judicial outcomes; and
(c) may include, among other things, statements regarding estimates and assumptions in respect of prices, costs, results and capital expenditure,
and are or may be based on assumptions and estimates related to future technical, economic, market, political, social and other conditions.
The words “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “indicate”, “contemplate”, “target”, “plan”, “intends”, “continue”, “budget”, “estimate”, “may”,
“will”, “schedule” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements. Recipients are cautioned
that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly recipients are cautioned not to put undue reliance
on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.
The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or results or otherwise.
