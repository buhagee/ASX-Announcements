Takeover bid by WAM Active for Keybridge
Capital – Update

3 July 2020

Today, Australian Securities & Investments Commission (“ASIC”) granted WAM Active Limited (WAM Active) the in
principle relief it required for it to proceed with its takeover offer for Keybridge Capital Limited (Keybridge Capital)
and it will separately release a replacement bidder’s statement once it has been lodged with ASIC. Details of the
relief granted in respect of the offer will be included in the replacement bidder’s statement.
In addition, on 29 June 2020 ASIC granted WAM Active conditional relief from the requirement under section
631(1)(b) of the Corporations Act for a bidder to make offers within 2 months of announcing a takeover proposal.
The relief would have allowed WAM Active until 7 July 2020 to make offers; WAM Active could not make offers by
this date. ASIC Class Order [CO 13/528] prohibited WAM Active from doing so. WAM Active was required to make an
ASX Announcement no later than 1 July 2020 to explain the relief; no announcement was made for this reason.
This announcement has been authorised by the board of WAM Active Limited.
