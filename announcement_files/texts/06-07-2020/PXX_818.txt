Drilling set to start at Zackly
copper-gold project next week

3,000m program will follow-up the thick high-grade mineralisation
intersected at end of previous field season
Key Points

Drilling is expected to commence by 18th July at Zackly East, following up on the
thick, high-grade gold and copper mineralisation intersected by drill holes ZX-18020
(55m @ 2.8g/t Au + 0.6% Cu) and ZX-18024 (47m @ 3.1g/t Au + 0.6% Cu).

at its high-priority Zackly East target within its Alaska Range project next week.
The preparations for drilling are well advanced and include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Drill contract for 3,000m of core drilling has been executed.
Two drill rigs are expected to arrive on site by 15 July, with drilling expected by 18 July.
Helicopter contract for mobilisation of drilling has been executed.
Site inspection has been completed indicting no impediments to drill rig access.
Drill pad preparation and access road maintenance has commenced.
Construction of the exploration camp will commence this week with the camp to be
fully operational by 15 July, when the exploration team is expected to be on site.

Share Purchase Plan Closing Soon
A Share Purchase Plan to raise up to $1 million is available to shareholders who were on the
Company’s share register at 7.00pm (AEST) on 17 June 2020 and having a registered address in
Australia or New Zealand. Participation in the Share Purchase Plan is optional but gives eligible
shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding by subscribing for up to $30,000 of
shares at $0.038 (3.8c) per ordinary share without paying brokerage fees or other transaction costs,
irrespective of the size of their shareholding. The Share Purchase Plan closes at 5.00pm (AEST) on
Wednesday 8th July 2020, unless extended by the Directors.
Planned Work Program – Alaska Range Project
The Zackly East Skarn occurs just 800m from the Zackly Main Skarn deposit, where PolarX has
outlined an Inferred Resource of 41,000t of copper, 213,000oz of gold and 1.5Moz silver from surface
(refer Table 1). This resource occurs over a strike length of 1,050m (Figure 2). Strongly mineralised
drill intersections to the east of the resource, including 55m @2.8g/t Au + 0.6% Cu and 47m @ 31.g/t
Au + 0.6% Cu, along with geological mapping and trenching to evaluate the potential 600m strikelength of the Zackly East skarn, indicate that the resource inventory may be increased as a result of
the planned drilling program.

An initial program of approximately 3,000m of drilling, comprising 15-20 drill holes has been planned
to evaluate a 500-600m strike length of the structure (Figure 3). Drilling will commence on the
existing section containing holes ZX-18020 and ZX-18024 to determine down-dip continuity. Stepout cross-sections will be drilled on 50m and 100m centres with precise details to be finalised on a
hole by hole basis using information gleaned from the previous drill holes.

Drilling is expected to take approximately six to eight weeks using two drill rigs. Updates on progress
will be provided on a regular basis.
