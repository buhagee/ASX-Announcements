Request for Trading Halt
Ms Elizabeth Harris
ASX Perth
Dear Ms Harris
Request for Trading Halt
I refer to our telephone conversations this morning regarding the “Market Update”
announcement lodged by Cirrus and request a trading halt.
In relation to the information required by Listing Rule 17.1, I note as follows:
1. The Company wishes to release an update on the Company’s contracts;
2. The trading halt is only required until this issue is discussed with ASX, which is
anticipated to be later today;
3. The ability to make a market update announcement along the lines of that already
lodged will end the need for the trading halt; and
4. The Company is not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be granted.
Yours faithfully

Catherine Anderson
Company Secretary
