$1.9M in the Q4 FY20 quarter, which is an improvement of 28% over the equivalent quarter in FY19.
This means that invoices raised for FY20 were $6.626M, which is a 60% increase on invoices raised for
FY19 ($4.145M).
As at 30 June 2020, the cash available was $2.9M. In addition, there was $1.13M in receivables from
Tier 1 clients. These numbers reflect the fact that during Q4 FY20, K2F’s current operations achieved
net positive cashflows with a strong $0.66M positive cash flow. This very encouraging number can be
explained by increased sales in the quarter as well as cash receipts from customers, which is evidenced
by the reduction in receivables from the previous quarter.

Sales and Marketing Update
K2F is very pleased to announce that it has recently signed a contract with Orano SA (Orano), formerly
known as Areva SA. Orano is a multinational nuclear fuel cycle company with uranium mining
operations, and is headquartered in France. Orano signed a five-year contract to implement the
RCubed resource governance solution, and the total contract value is in excess of AU$300k.
Since the acquisition of RCubed, K2F has won a number of contracts with significant global mining
clients. New clients include: Imerys, Glencore Canada, Nexa Resources, Rio Tinto, Newcrest,
Goldfields, Newmont, Sibelco, Kinross Gold, Orano and South 32. In addition, existing SaaS clients of
K2F’s RCubed and Infoscope solutions extended their licencing agreements: Teck Resources (3 years),
Westgold (5 years) and AngloGold Ashanti (3 years).
In Q4 the addition of Kinross Gold, Sibelco, Orano and South 32 has been gratifying as it is evident that
more and more mining companies appreciate the benefits of our SaaS offerings. Based upon recent
discussions and negotiations, K2F is confident that there will be more new name client
announcements to be made in 2020. Of course, until signed, there are no guarantees that these
contracts will be finalised.
With the additional contracts in Q4 for K2F’s RCubed resource governance solution, net new annual
recurring revenues for these contracts have exceeded $500k. This is the final milestone in the revenue
acquisition performance milestones for RCubed, which were set to be achieved over a three-year
period. The revenue acquisition performance milestones have now been achieved in just thirteen
months since acquisition.
Announcement released with authority of K2F board.
