About the Butcherbird Manganese Project
The Butcherbird Manganese Project is a world class manganese resource with current JORC resources in
excess of 263 Mt of manganese ore1. The Company has recently completed a Pre-Feasibility Study with
respect to developing the deposit to produce manganese concentrate for export to generate early
cashflow with a modest capital requirement2. The outstanding economics and low capital hurdle of less
than A$15 million will allow the Company to develop the project in a relatively short timeframe.
This is envisaged as the first stage of a staged ramp up for the project and has the advantage of potentially
providing early cashflow to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and assist in funding of the larger
high purity manganese production hub which is the subject of a parallel, complimentary work stream.
The Project straddles the Great Northern Highway and the Goldfields Gas Pipeline providing turnkey
logistics and energy solutions. The Company is also intending to integrate renewable energy into the
power solution to minimise the carbon intensity of the Project as well as reducing energy costs. A cleaner,
lower carbon flowsheet and high penetration renewable energy will place Butcherbird at the forefront of
sustainable metal production.
