US URANIUM / VANADIUM PROJECT
VANADIUM FIELD SAMPLING RESULTS POSITIVE
URANIUM RESULTS PENDING FROM SPECIALIST LAB
The directors of Thor Mining Plc (“Thor” or the “Company”) (AIM, ASX: THR) are pleased
to advise positive assay results from samples identified as having vanadium potential from
field sampling in the Colorado mineral claims held by American Vanadium Pty Ltd (AVU).
Other samples identified as potentially uranium rich, are being assayed at a separate
laboratory facility which is better equipped for samples of this nature.
AVU holds interests in uranium and vanadium focussed projects in Colorado and Utah in
the United States of America (Figure 1). The Company announced on 1 June 2020 an
option agreement to acquire AVU, subject to satisfaction of due diligence requirements.
Highlights:
• The eight initial assay results averaged 1.0% V2O5 and 0.043% U3O8.
• Two outcrop samples from the Rim Rock mine were 1.8% and 2.0% V2O5.
• Eight of the twenty-one field samples had radioactivity levels low enough for routine
assay process to be completed.
• The remaining 13 samples have been transported to a specialist laboratory with
facilities designed to handle higher radiation level material.
Mick Billing, Executive Chairman of Thor Mining, commented:
“We are very pleased with the calibre of the vanadium samples collected, and in
particular the uranium content of several of these.”
“Assays of the higher-level radioactive samples are eagerly awaited. These assay
results are expected later in July.”

The field component of the due diligence program undertaken by the company’s Colorado based team
has included sampling of accessible mineralisation in multiple locations across the mining claim area
(Figure 2). Mineralisation predominantly occurs in the Salt Wash geological unit (shaded orange) where
most sample locations occur. A combination of in situ outcrop samples and historic mine dump samples
were sampled.
Mineralisation varies between vanadium rich and uranium rich. Only assay results have been received
from vanadium rich samples at this time as summarised in Table A.

Figure 2: Sample location plan showing simplified geology and mining claim areas

Sampling was not conducted at the Vanadium King site in Utah as the mineralised Salt Wash formation
does not outcrop in the project area and there has been no mining disturbance.

PROJECT ACQUISITION
On June 1st 2020 the Company advised it had acquired an exclusive option to acquire 100% of the shares
in American Vanadium Pty Ltd, a private Australian company, which in turn owns 100% each of the shares
in Colorado company Standard Minerals INC (Standard), and Utah company Cisco Minerals INC (Cisco).
A processing plant which has historically taken ore from the region on a toll treatment basis is located
near Blanding, within relatively close proximity to the claims held by these companies. Thor have not

had contact with the operators of this plant to date, however this may represent a potential low cost
entry into production.

Colorado Claims
Standard holds 199 contiguous Bureau of Land Management (BLM) claims in south west Colorado, and
within the Uravan Mineral Belt. The claims include the Wedding Bell and Radium Mountain groups of
mines which are reported to have operated during the first world war and again in the second half of the
20th century (USGS Professional paper 300a).

The Uravan Mineral Belt and adjacent uranium-vanadium mining districts of the Colorado Plateau are
reported to have produced, over the past 100 years, in excess of 85million lbs U3O8 and over 660 million
lbs of V2O5² from the Salt Wash sandstone formation of the Plateau. The average production grades from
the Uravan Mineral Belt from the 1940’s to January 1979 are reported be 0.25% U3O8 and 1.29% V2O5
(Thamm. et al., 1981b) Average vanadium to uranium ratios are reported to vary from 0.5 : 1 to 40 : 1.

Utah Claims
Cisco holds 100 BLM claims in south east Utah approximately 40km north of the town of Moab. There is
reporting of significant uranium and vanadium mineralised body(ies) from drilling activities by Hunt Oil,
Mineral Division, in 1980 and 1981, reported by Terra Ventures (TSX-V: TAS) in a report dated May 21
2007.
https://www.thormining.com/sites/thormining/media/miscellaneous/terra-ventures-20070521.pdf
Thor Mining wishes to reiterate that the Hunt Oil estimate 1980 – 81 does not comply with either
the JORC or NI 43-101 guidelines for mineral resource reporting and is therefore not a valid
resource estimate. The Hunt Oil estimate does however provide substantial indication of
widespread uranium - vanadium mineralisation in the Cisco mineral claims in a similar geological
setting to multiple deposits elsewhere in the region including the previously mined Colorado
mineral claims included in this acquisition.
The review team visited the site to assess access issues associated with potential drilling campaigns. The
area has good local infrastructure and is at the northern margin of the historic uranium mining area of
Thompson Yellow Cat mining district.

Figure 6: Vanadium King (Utah) terrain

Available data to date of the Vanadium King (Utah) historical drilling suggest that the drilling programs
focussed upon mineralisation in the Brushy Basin Member of the Jurassic Morrison Formation. Thor’s
local consultants have suggested that the deeper and normally higher grade Salt Wash Member may
remain substantially untested. Historical mining of the nearby Thompson Creek group of mines have
historically produced high grade ore from the Salt Wash Member – a likely focus for future work by Thor.

Sampling
techniques

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.

• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this
would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling
was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases more explanation may be required, such as where
there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems.
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample
recoveries and results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and

Commentary

• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of
high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results,
the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated
and some typical examples of such aggregations should be
shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.
• These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg
‘down hole length, true width not known’).
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported These should include,
but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations
and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is
not practicable, representative reporting of both low and
high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid
misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should
be reported including (but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics;
potential deleterious or contaminating substances.
• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for
lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale stepout drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible
extensions, including the main geological interpretations
and future drilling areas, provided this information is not
commercially sensitive.
