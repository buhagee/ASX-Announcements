PENGANA PRIVATE EQUITY TRUST
ANNOUNCES OVERSUBSCRIBED RIGHTS ISSUE

Pengana Investment Management Limited (‘PIML’, ‘Responsible Entity’) is pleased to announce that the
Pengana Private Equity Trust (‘the Trust’, ASX: PE1) pro-rata non-renounceable rights issue (‘Rights Issue’)
closed on 6 July 2020 with demand exceeding the $68 million offer amount, subject to final settlement of
proceeds.
Significantly, the unit price of the Trust traded at a premium to its net asset value per unit throughout
the offer period. This is extremely unusual and further indicates the support PE1 enjoys from both
existing and new investors.
Later today the Responsible Entity expects to announce the details of the completion of the Rights Issue and
Shortfall allocation to both existing investors and new sophisticated investors, with an additional shortfall
allocation to new sophisticated investors expected to be completed and announced to the market by
Wednesday 15th July 2020.

Russel Pillemer, CEO of Pengana Capital Group said: “We are extremely pleased by the success of the
Rights Issue which we anticipate will create substantial long-term value for unitholders. PE1 is a truly unique
offering, providing Australian investors with access, via a listed vehicle, to a diversified portfolio of global
private equity investments, managed by GCM Grosvenor, one of the largest allocators to alternative assets in
the world. It’s great to see Australian retail and HNW investors embracing private equity, an asset class that
has the potential to significantly improve their portfolios.”
