Candy Club achieves 135% (quarterly) increase in key B2B revenue
Quarterly Activities Report & Appendix 4C for the quarter ended 30 June 2020

Melbourne, Australia – Candy Club Holdings Limited (ASX: CLB) ("Candy Club" or "the Company") is
pleased to announce its results for the three months ending 30 June 2020 ("2Q FY2020").
Candy Club has recorded a remarkable 2Q FY2020 result amid an extremely challenging operating
environment, validating management’s view that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macroeconomic
conditions will not negatively impact the Company’s growth trajectory.
The Company continued to demonstrate strong growth throughout the quarter, primarily in its key business-tobusiness (“B2B”) segment which recorded spectacular growth.
The Company reiterates that it is on target to reach profitability (EBITDA-positive) in 4Q FY2020, a result that
will be driven primarily by the strategic shift to focus on B2B customer acquisition in September 2019.
Concurrently, Candy Club would like to inform shareholders of a change in the Company’s reporting currency
from Australian Dollars to US Dollars, commencing 2Q FY2020. The Company believes this change will better
reflect its underlying operational and financial performance as it eliminates irrelevant changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.. Historical financial information in this document has been restated to US dollars.

Key highlights include:
•

Total gross revenues grew 67% quarter-on-quarter ("QoQ") to US$2.3 million, mainly driven by 135%
growth in B2B gross revenue. Year-on-year (“YoY”), growth in B2B gross revenue was 503%.

•

Gross margins remained stable during the quarter, standing at 41.4%, while EBITDA loss continued to
reduce, at only -US$0.4 million for the quarter.

•

Candy Club expects to reach profitability (EBITDA-positive) with its current balance sheet and available
financing facilities in 4Q FY2020 as it continues to focus on sustainably scaling its business.

•

NOCF improved to -US$0.9 million QoQ in 2Q FY2020 from -US$1.2m. The difference between the
EBITDA loss and NOCF can be attributed to inventory purchases required to support future growth
(US$365k), financing costs related to securing financing lines (US$100k) and interest (US$35k).

•

As the pandemic situation eventually normalises in the US, Candy Club expects the traditional brick-andmortar B2B pipeline to have a robust return, which will fuel future revenue growth.

Operational Performance
Since the Company pivoted its focus to the B2B segment in September 2019, the segment has been performing
exceptionally well. The B2B segment has become the main driver leading Candy Club to a new era of growth. In
2Q FY2020, the segment’s total gross revenue grew 135% QoQ to US$1.6m.

For personal use only

The growth is mainly on the back of sales surge from retailers (providing essential services) which are
unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic closures, online pureplay e-commerce boutiques and traditional brickand-mortar e-commerce websites.

This validates the Company's "white space strategy" – which identifies and targets retail opportunities within
existing retail chains – despite experiencing significant closures of traditional brick-and-mortar stores in the US.
All of the B2B segment’s key metrics reached significant milestones during the quarter. Candy Club’s total
number of retail doors continued to increase significantly, from 4500 in December 2019 to more than 8800 June
2020, while the number of B2B customers has more than doubled to almost 4500 in the same period.
Candy Club expects this growth trajectory to continue, with the total number of retail doors and customers to
exceed 15,000 and 10,000, respectively, by the end of FY2020.
Candy Club’s re-order rates remain healthy as a result of extremely strong consumer demand and strong sellthrough rates. Re-order rate is the rate a B2B customer repeats an order. The average quarterly re-order rate
has exceeded 90% in three of the last four quarters. Repeat orders represent customer satisfaction in the
products purchased. The high re-order rate is bolstered by positive feedback and high ratings received from
customers on retailers’ websites.

^ The lower re-order rate in 4Q FY2020 was mainly due to a massive influx
of new customers during the quarter.

The B2C segment also saw a solid performance. The subscription-based segment is profitable as a standalone
business on the first customer consignment.

“The results we have had in just six months of FY2020 are phenomenal, especially in this challenging
environment. Our pivot last year to focus on B2B is working as expected and we continue to see it paying off
and driving forward value to shareholders”, said Candy Club founder and CEO Keith Cohn. “These results in
what is normally a quieter time in our industry alongside a global pandemic shows the strength of our brand and
strategy.”
Financial Performance
Candy Club once again reported a record quarter, with total gross revenues of US$2.3 million representing a
67% growth QoQ. This is a spectacular achievement given the challenging operating environment. 2Q FY2020
is also a seasonally softer quarter.
The main driver to this growth was the B2B segment, which has been the Company’s key strategic focus since
September 2019. The segment grew 135% QoQ to US$1.6 million.
Despite the majority of Candy Club’s largest national retail partners experiencing widespread store closures
throughout the quarter as a result of the pandemic, the company was still able to grow substantially in the
period. This demonstrates the Company has a robust business model that works even in challenging times.
Gross margins remained relatively stable during the quarter, standing at 41.4%.
EBITDA loss continued to lessen, at only -US$0.4 million. Candy Club expects to reach profitability (EBITDApositive) in 4Q FY2020 as it continues to focus on sustainably scaling its business.
The difference between the EBITDA loss and NOCF is the increase in inventory purchases required to support
future growth (US$365k), financing costs related to securing financing lines (US$100k) and interest (US$35k).
NOCF will remain negative in the short term to support necessary inventory purchases resulting from further
anticipated growth. There is availability under the inventory credit facility that will be used to support near-term
cash requirements.

Commentary
Candy Club managed to remain focused and drive an increase in shareholder value amid the COVID-19
pandemic and a quarter that is usually seasonally softer.
Candy Club enters the second half of FY2020 with a very promising outlook.
In its B2B segment, the total number of inbound customer leads are ramping rapidly. Generally, 35% of total
B2B inbound customer leads convert to B2B customers. This will eventually translate into additional B2B
customers, ensuring a robust pipeline of customers to fuel future revenue growth.

As the situation in the US normalises, Candy Club expects the traditional brick-and-mortar B2B retailers to
return and B2B revenue growth to accelerate further.
Candy Club’s key strategy is to acquire prominent national retail accounts, owning the under-utilised retail space
at point-of-sale.

“From a financial and operating standpoint, I could not be happier with Candy Club and the team behind the
company. Revenue, EBITDA and NOCF are improving, and our strategy to have the B2B segment as the focus
of the Company after our pivot seems to be working, as shown by the big growth numbers,” said Candy Club
Chairman James Baillieu. “We have encouraging tailwinds, and we are turning profitable by the end of the year.
This is one of the most exciting times to be an investor and Chairman of a company, as there are exponential
growth and lots of energy in this business.”

Variance

Explanation of material differences in the table above:
The Company considers the only material difference relates to increasing sales staff. IPO funds were not used
to increase sales staff as intended as existing staff were able to be utilised more actively in sales and
automation enhancements made it possible to add incremental sales staff without increasing overall operating
expenses.
The Company has reported its cash flows on a quarterly basis since listing on ASX and considers the use of
funds to be consistent with its disclosures since ASX Listing.
Payments to related parties in June 2020 quarter
Payments to related parties and their associates during the quarter was $120K which consists of salaries for the
CEO, Keth Cohn, and one non-executive director, Andrew Clark, who is also actively engaged in a consulting
capacity.

(927)

1,140
1.23

Does the entity expect that it will continue to have the current level of net operating
cash flows for the time being and, if not, why not?

Answer: No. Net operating cash outflows continue to decrease QoQ as the business
continues to scale up. At the same time the company has been able to keep its
fixed expenses flat on a QoQ basis, resulting in a reduction of NOCF each of the
last several quarters. The company expects that trend to continue in the upcoming
quarters as well.
2.

Has the entity taken any steps, or does it propose to take any steps, to raise further
cash to fund its operations and, if so, what are those steps and how likely does it
believe that they will be successful?

Appendix 4C
Quarterly cash flow report for entities subject to Listing Rule 4.7B
Answer: Yes. Candy Club has existing financing relationships with Crossroads Financial,
LLC to access working capital against the value of its inventory and Versant
Funding, LLC to sell certain Accounts Receivables to accelerate its cash collections
cycles. In addition, the company is currently in talks to access additional debt
and/or equity financing should it outgrow their existing working capital lines or
determine that additional working capital could assist in accelerating growth further.
The company is highly confident that it will be successful in accessing additional
funds if required to do so.
3.

Does the entity expect to be able to continue its operations and to meet its business
objectives and, if so, on what basis?

Answer: Yes. The combination of increasing revenue and gross margins dollars on a QoQ
basis, the ability to scale while holding fixed overhead flat, existing financing
partnership arrangements and the potential to secure additional financing, if
required, give us a high degree of confidence that the company will continue to
meet its business objectives.
