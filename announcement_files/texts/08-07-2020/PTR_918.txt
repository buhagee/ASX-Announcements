ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
08 July 2020

Petratherm executes Glenfine Gold Project (Victoria)
Farm-in and Joint Venture Agreement
Highlights
•

Petratherm has entered into an agreement to acquire up to an 80% interest, with further provisions
to potentially acquire a 100% interest in the Glenfine Gold Project, in the central Victorian Goldfields,
close to the world class Ballarat (13.1 Moz) and Berringa (1.0 Moz) goldfields.

•

The Glenfine area has historic gold production of approximately 400,000 oz.

•

The Glenfine Project is characterised by a large elongate basalt dome, the “Glenfine Dome’ where
widely spaced drilling demonstrates gold mineralisation and alteration occurring over at least a 20kilometre trend and remains open to the north. It is considered to be in an analogous setting to the
Cambrian Magdala Volcanic Dome which hosts the 5.2 M oz Stawell gold deposit.

•

In addition, significant, vein hosted “Ballarat Style” high-grade gold has been drilled at both the
Glenfine and British Banner Prospects on the eastern side of the dome, with mineralisation remaining
open along trend and at depth. Several other early stage gold prospects occur on the tenements.

•

Glenfine comprises 3 contiguous tenements (EL’s 5434, EL 5537 & EL 5344) totalling 96 km2. Most of
the tenement area is under shallow cover and consequently only lightly explored.

Petratherm Limited (“Petratherm” or “the Company”) (ASX: PTR) is pleased to announce that it has entered
into a Farm-in and Joint Venture Agreement with, Cape Clear Minerals Pty Ltd (CCM) and Predictive Discovery
Ltd (ASX: PDI) on their Glenfine Gold Project, which demonstrates potential for both Stawell-Style (basalt dome
hosted) gold mineralisation and Ballarat-Style (vein hosted) gold mineralisation. The Glenfine Project is located
25 kilometres southwest of Ballarat and comprises 3 contiguous tenements (EL’s 5434, EL 5537 & EL 5344)
totalling 96 km2 (Figure 1).
Significant deep lead and hard rock gold production has been documented from the tenements, and the
surrounding area has been one of the largest gold-producing regions of Victoria. There are numerous gold
occurrences at Glenfine, historically known as the Pitfield Plains Goldfield (Figure 1). The goldfield has an
estimated combined historical gold production of approximately 400,000oz from alluvial, deep lead and hard
rock mining. The most significant hard-rock production on the tenements came from the Glenfine South Mine

where 43,693 oz of gold were reported mined between 1899 and 1907 (source: Victorian Geological Survey
Report No 94).

Stawell Style Gold

For personal use only

The Glenfine project covers a 30-kilometre section of the crustal scale, west dipping Avoca Fault that separates
the Stawell Zone in the west from the Ballarat-Bendigo Zone in the east. It is considered to provide a fluid
conduit for extensive gold mineralisation hosted in the subjacent rock sequences. In this region along the
margin of the fault is a large (+20km long) elongate basalt dome structure, the ‘Glenfine Dome’ and is
considered to be in an analogous setting to the Cambrian Magdala Volcanic Dome, which hosts the Stawell
gold deposits (5.2 Moz), adjacent to the crustal scale west dipping Coongee Fault at Stawell in western Victoria.

Recent historical air-core drilling and follow-up diamond drilling has defined extensive gold mineralisation on
the basalt - sediment interface zone along the eastern and western flanks of the Glenfine Dome, occurring
over at least 20 kilometres of total strike length when both sides of the dome edge are considered, and it
remains open to the north (Figure 2). The dome is under shallow younger cover however as the basalt has high
specific density, detailed gravity surveying clearly defines its extent (Figure 2).
Historical hard rock mining mainly exploited vein-hosted mineralisation, however there is evidence of gold
mineralisation mined from the margins of the Glenfine Dome as well. This speaks to a high potential for
undiscovered economic deposits of bedrock gold in both styles.

Ballarat Style Gold

For personal use only

In addition to the regional basalt dome drill testing, high-grade quartz reef gold drill intercepts have been
returned from the Glenfine and British Banner Prospect Areas (Figure 2) located on the east side of the basalt.
The gold mineralisation at both prospects are open along strike and at depth. At Glenfine, the drilling reported
herein, is a vein discovery termed the Glenfine Reef 2, which occurs immediately south of the main historic
workings along trend with known mineralisation. The mineralisation occurs as singular or multiple quartz reefs
and is interpreted to be akin to conventional central Victorian or “Ballarat Style” quartz reef coarse gold with
pyrite-arsenopyrite-galena-sphalerite mineralisation (Photo 1). Significant carbonate-chlorite alteration
haloes up to 20m wide also surround the mineralised zones.
Notable recorded gold intersections (not true width) include:

Joint Venture Terms

For personal use only

The key terms of the Farm-in and Joint Agreement whereby Petratherm may acquire up to an 80%
interest, with further provision to earn 100% interest in the tenements are presented below.
•

Condition Precedent – The Agreement and its obligations are subject to PTR being satisfied in respect
of the tenements within a 21-day due diligence period.

•

Stage 1 - PTR may earn a 51% interest by spending a total of $1,000,000 on exploration within a 3year period, of which at least $100,000 must be spent within the first 12 months.

•

Stage 2 - PTR may earn an additional 29% interest (for a total of 80% interest) by spending a further
$2,000,000 on exploration within an additional 2.5-year period.

•

Once PTR have earned an 80% interest the parties can elect to contribute their equity share or dilute
following a standard industry formula.

•

If CCM/PDI interest reduces to 10% or less, this will constitute a notice of withdrawal and PTR will
acquire 100% interest in the tenements and CCM/PDI shall be entitled to receive a 1 % Net Smelter
Royalty in respect of all minerals produced from the Joint Venture Area.

Next Steps

For personal use only

The Glenfine Project has considerable scope for the discovery of significant concealed gold resources. The
primary target for the project is “Stawell Style” gold mineralisation under cover along the margins of the
Glenfine Dome. The dome margins remain largely un-explored and will form an initial focus for future drilling.
A second target akin to conventional central Victorian or “Ballarat Style” quartz reef coarse gold is also evident
from drilling and Glenfine and British Banner Prospects on the east flank of the Glenfine Basalt Dome. These
high-grade gold intercepts remain open along trend and at depth. Other un-discovered reef shoots are likely
to be present along these mineralised structural trends requiring step out exploration.

Initial technical works will involve a detailed review of the drilling data including re-logging and appraisal of
the extensive drill core to produce 3D structural models of the gold zones to aid future drill targeting. Once
the Company has completed this work, further Prospect details and the ground exploration work program will
be provided. Glenfine offers the opportunity to rapidly confirm several ‘walk-up’ drilling targets testing both
Stawell-style and Ballarat-style gold mineralisation.

JORC Code explanation
Sampling
techniques

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry
standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.).
These examples should not be taken as limiting the
broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate calibration
of any measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been
done this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples
from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g
charge for fire assay’). In other cases, more
explanation may be required, such as where there is
coarse Au that has inherent sampling problems.
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of
detailed information.

The results in this Report
are historical and as such
many details are unknown.
Results presented have
been compiled from
historical open-file and
private company technical
reports and data.
Diamond core sampling
was undertaken using
standard industry practices
and standard operating
procedures. The sections
of core selected for
assaying are marked up,
digitally recorded for
cutting and sampling at a
certified geotechnical
laboratory. Geochemical
sampling involved half
core analysis.
RC sampling methods are
not recorded in historical
reporting and hence are
unknown.
Core sections sampled
were based from
geological logging which
aided determination of
representative rock
sequences and where
quartz reef or
mineralisation was
observed.
Core sample lengths were
determined by width of
potential mineralised
interval and/or from
geological changes
observed and ranged from
20 cm to 2 metres in
general.
Individual sample weights
varied based on length of
half core sampled. It is not
known how samples were
prepared; however gold
assays were reported
using industry standard
fire assay techniques.

Drilling
techniques

• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc.)
and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube,
depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what
method, etc.).

Drill sample
recovery

• Method of recording and assessing core and chip
sample recoveries and results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and
ensure representative nature of the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample
recovery and grade and whether sample bias may
have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of
fine/coarse material.
• Whether core and chip samples have been
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of
detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource
estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) photography.
• The total length and percentage of the relevant
intersections logged.

• Previous Drilling includes:
OHRC01 – OHRC03 and
PRC02 drilled by RC
method. PFD and CCD
series holes are diamond
holes.
• Results in this Report are
historical and as such
additional details are
unknown.
• Down hole surveys
approximately every 30m,
were undertaken for
diamond drilling but the
surveying system used is
not known. Core is
orientated where possible.
• Results in this Report are
historical and as such these

• Based on historical drilling
data tables, core recovery
was good and results
presented are therefore
representative.
• Results in this Report are

Geology

• Deposit type, geological setting and style of
mineralisation.

Drill hole
Information

• A summary of all information material to the
understanding of the exploration results including a
tabulation of the following information for all Material
drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above
sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the
basis that the information is not Material and this
exclusion does not detract from the understanding of
the report, the Competent Person should clearly
explain why this is the case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade
truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off
grades are usually Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths
of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade
results, the procedure used for such aggregation
should be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.

Data
aggregation
methods

•

Petratherm is exploring for
high-grade orogenic gold.
The primary target for the
project is “Stawell Style”
gold mineralisation, under
cover along the margins of
the Glenfine Dome. A
second target akin to
conventional central
Victorian or “Ballarat Style”
quartz reef coarse gold is
also evident from historical
drilling.
• Summary tables of drill hole
details included in Table 1
and Table 2 in the main
body of the report.
• True widths of intercepts
reported is not yet known.

• The results in this Report
are historical and as such
these details are unknown.
• No metal equivalents have
been used.

JORC Code explanation

Relationship
between
mineralisati
on widths
and
intercept
lengths

• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.
• These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to
the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be
reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this
effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).

Diagrams

Balanced
reporting

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole
collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of
both low and high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.

Commentary

•

Down hole length has
been reported, as true
width is not known, as
insufficient work has been
undertaken to understand
the true width of intervals.

•

Plan view of regional drill
collar locations has been
shown in the body of this
report.

•

The reporting is
considered balanced. This
is the first announcement
by the Company outlining
a new project venture.
Additional reporting of
historical exploration
results will occur once the
Company has been able to
compile historical drill hole
data into a 3D model
during the next phase of
exploration ground works.
Not applicable – no
exploration data is being
reported only historical
drilling results.

•

Other
substantive
exploration
data

• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material,
should be reported including (but not limited to):
geological observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.

•

Further
work

• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or
large-scale step-out drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible
extensions, including the main geological
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this
information is not commercially sensitive.

•

A range of exploration
techniques are being
considered to progress
exploration including
geophysical surveying to
aid drill targeting and
further drilling.
