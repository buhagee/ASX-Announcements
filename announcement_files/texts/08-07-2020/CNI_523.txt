Acceptances to Centuria’s full takeover represent 65.86% of Augusta’s shares1
Takeover offer is now unconditional, providing NZ$0.22 in cash plus 0.392 Centuria stapled securities for

Centuria AUM increases 24% on offer completion to A$8.9 billion

SYDNEY (8 July 2020) – Centuria Capital Group (ASX: CNI), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Centuria
New Zealand Holdings Limited (“Centuria NZ”), has declared its full takeover offer for Augusta Capital (NZX:
AUG or “Augusta”) unconditional1.
Since opening the offer on 29 June 2020, Centuria NZ has acceptances which, together with its existing
shareholdings in Augusta, represent 65.86% of Augusta’s shares.
John McBain, Centuria Joint CEO, said, “I am delighted to report close to two-thirds of Augusta shares1 have
been secured within eight business days of the takeover offer commencing and to report that Centuria has
declared the offer unconditional.
“We are encouraged by the significant response and we are looking forward to completion of the offer and
expanding Centuria’s funds management platform into the New Zealand market. Augusta is a substantial
player in this market with a highly effective team. We anticipate New Zealand to be an important growth
engine within the Centuria platform.
“Moreover, given the relative strength of the Australian commercial market, the position Centuria enjoys on the
S&P/ASX 300 and Centuria’s strong distribution history, we are excited for so many Augusta shareholders
taking up Centuria scrip.”
Progress of the offer
On 30 June, Centuria NZ varied its offer by increasing the cash component from NZ$0.20 to NZ$0.22 per
Augusta share. The scrip component of 0.392 Centuria stapled securities per Augusta share remained
unchanged. On that date, Centuria NZ also indicated its intention for the offer to become unconditional if
acceptances were received which, together with Centuria NZ’s existing shareholdings, represented 63.5% of
Augusta’s shares.
As at 8 July, acceptances of the offer, together with Centuria’s existing shareholding, represent 65.86% of
Augusta’s shares.
Centuria NZ has notified the increase in the cash component of the offer to Augusta shareholders. All
shareholders who have accepted the offer will receive the higher cash component.
