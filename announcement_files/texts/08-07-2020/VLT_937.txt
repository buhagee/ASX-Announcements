ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
Damstra Holdings to Acquire Vault Intelligence
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

8 July 2020: Vault Intelligence Limited (Vault) (ASX: VLT) ​and D
​ amstra Holdings Limited
(Damstra) (ASX: DTC) ​are pleased to announce that they have entered into a Scheme
Implementation Deed under which it is proposed that Damstra will acquire 100% of the equity
interests in Vault by way of a scheme of arrangement (​Scheme​) that is subject to Vault
shareholder approval and court approval in accordance with Part 5.1 of the Australian
Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
Damstra is a global provider of integrated workplace management solutions with a market
capitalisation of circa $188m.
Under the Scheme, the acquisition consideration payable by Damstra will be 100% scrip for the
acquisition of approximately 128m Vault shares and 10.2m unlisted options. Vault shareholders
will receive 1 Damstra ordinary share per 2.9 Vault ordinary shares (​Scheme Consideration​) and
Vault will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Damstra.
The Scheme Consideration values Vault’s issued ordinary shares at approximately A$58.8m
(based on the closing market price of Damstra shares immediately before the date of this
announcement).
Vault Directors Unanimous Recommendation
Each of Vault’s Directors considers the Scheme to be in the best interests of Vault’s shareholders
and unanimously recommend that Vault's shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme. This is
subject to no superior proposal emerging and an independent expert determining that the
Scheme is in the best interests of Vault's shareholders.
Subject to the same qualifications, each Vault Director intends to vote the Vault shares held or
controlled by them in favour of the proposed Scheme.
Vault Chairman, Ross Jenkins, said​:
“The Scheme provides an attractive outcome for Vault shareholders, employees and customers.
Vault shareholders will continue to have exposure to the Vault product suite and will become
part of a larger company which provides improved future growth and opportunities.”

“The Board believes the premium pricing is a good measure of where Vault currently is as a
business. Strategic synergies between Vault and Damstra at a product and customer level will
also provide immediate opportunities for the combined group and, importantly, Vault will be able
to access Damstra’s developing overseas sales pipeline.”
Strategic Rationale
Vault’s Directors believe this is a compelling offer for Vault shareholders for the following
reasons:
●

●

●

●

●

Attractive Premium
Based on the closing prices of Vault Shares and Damstra Shares on 6 July 2020
the implied value ($1.345 divided by 2.9 = $0.464) of the offer represents:
○ 36.5% premium to the closing price of A$0.34 per Vault Share
○ 60% premium to the 30 Day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of A$0.26
per Vault Share
Superior Growth Opportunities
○ Vault has developed an exceptional product but is a relatively small company
with limited resources
○ Through the Scheme, Vault will become part of Damstra and be able to utilise
Damstra’s scale and channels to seek to accelerate sales and revenue growth
Greater Resources and Reach
○ Damstra currently has in excess of 130+ staff, is well resourced, financed and is
profitable
○ Damstra has a significant reach and presence in verticals and customers relevant
for the sale and expansion of Vault products and in particular Vault Solo
○ Damstra has established and expanded into the US and EU markets with
customers and this will provide an excellent launching pad for Vault products
Combined Synergies
○ Significant savings are expected to be made in merging and combining resources,
functions and processes of approximately $4m
○ Combining IP, skillsets and expertise to innovate and develop current product
ranges and embrace emerging technology
○ Provides front running product capability for emerging technology in the
Workforce Management sector
Long Term Sustainable Growth
○ Increased financial scale and market relevance
○ Anticipate eligibility and growth associated with entry into ​S&P/ASX 200
Information Technology (Sector)

Vault Managing Director, David Moylan, said:
“We are very excited to propose the Scheme to shareholders; it is a highly attractive deal at a
substantial premium that will allow the Company to continue on its growth trajectory. Becoming
a part of Damstra will allow us to tap into their extensive client base and this opens up a
significant opportunity to cross-sell Vault’s products to existing Damstra customers. Additionally,

the combining of the two entities firmly places Damstra at the forefront of emerging technology
for managing and protecting workforces.
“Vault will become a valuable arm of Damstra’s business and expand its comprehensive
solutions offerings. Vault’s management team remains committed to delivering value for
shareholders and will continue working within Damstra to realise and accelerate the potential of
Vault’s workforce performance products.
“Existing Vault customers can have confidence that the merged companies are well financed,
will have access to the high quality Damstra product suite, and will continue to develop
innovative and class leading solutions for risk management.”
Damstra Holdings Chairman, Johannes Risseeuw, said​:
“The merger of these two world class workplace management solution providers represents a
compelling opportunity for both sets of shareholders. The combination enables us to fast track
our respective growth plans, cross sell products and continue innovative product design to
deliver for our customers.”
“The merger also provides material operating, financial, and strategic synergies, while we see a
seamless integration of the two R&D teams to ensure continued expansion of product design
and delivery.”
“Damstra’s vision is to build a great global technology success story and is excited to have the
Vault product suite and team become an integral part of achieving this.”

Details of the Scheme Implementation Deed
The Scheme Implementation Deed (​SID​) entered into between Damstra and Vault contains
customary terms and conditions on which Vault and Damstra will implement the Scheme
including the approval of Vault shareholders and court approval. Other key terms of the SID
include:
● A number of other conditions precedent including that no material adverse event (as
defined in the SID) and no prescribed occurrence (as also defined) has occurred in
relation to Damstra or Vault;

2.2

Vault to propose Scheme
(a)

Vault agrees to propose and implement the Scheme on and subject to the terms of
this deed.

(b)

Vault must not consent to any modification of, or amendment to, the Scheme, or to
the making or imposition by the Court of any condition in respect of the Scheme,
without the prior written consent of Damstra.

(c)

Damstra agrees to assist Vault in proposing and implementing the Scheme on and
subject to the terms of this deed.

Scheme Consideration
(a)

Each Scheme Shareholder will be entitled to receive the Scheme Consideration in
respect of each of their Scheme Shares, on and subject to the terms of the
Scheme.

(b)

Subject to clause 2.2(c) and the Scheme becoming Effective, Damstra undertakes
and warrants to Vault (in Vault’s own right and separately as trustee for each of the

For personal use only

make the recommendation referred to in clause 2.4(b)(i) and the statement referred
to in clause 2.4(b)(ii).

(b)

Subject to clause 2.4(c), Vault must ensure that the Scheme Booklet and the
announcement referred to in clause 11.1 state that each Vault Director:
(i)

recommends that Vault Shareholders vote in favour of the resolution to
approve the Scheme; and

(i)

it is reasonable and appropriate to agree to pay the Break Fee or the
Reverse Break Fee (as applicable) to secure the other party’s entry into this

Scheme is not or is no longer in the best interests of Vault Shareholders, except
where that conclusion is due (in whole or in part) to the existence of a Competing
Proposal;

7.3

(b)

Damstra terminates this deed in accordance with clause 10.1(b); or

(c)

a Competing Proposal is announced or made before the Second Court Date, and,

Nature of payment
The payment by a party under clauses 7.2 or 7.3 is an amount to compensate the other
party for the following costs and expenses:
(a)

external advisory costs (excluding success fees);

(b)

internal costs such as costs of management and directors’ time, risk management

and the parties agree that:

7.5

(e)

the costs actually incurred by each party will be of such a nature that they cannot
all be accurately ascertained; and

each of the Break Fee and Reverse Break Fee is a genuine and reasonable preestimate of those costs to either party.

Qualifications to Break Fee and Reverse Break Fee
(a)

No amount is payable by Vault or Damstra under this clause 7 if the Scheme
becomes Effective.

(b)

If it is finally determined following the exhaustion of all reasonable avenues of
appeal to the Takeovers Panel or a court that all or any part of the Break Fee or
Reverse Break required to be paid under 7.2 or 7.3 (as applicable) (Break Fee
Impugned Amount):
(i)

constitutes or would constitute unacceptable circumstances as declared by
the Takeovers Panel;

(ii)

involves a breach of the fiduciary or statutory duties of any Vault Director or
Damstra Director (as applicable); or

(iii)

is unlawful,

then the requirement to pay the Break Fee or Reverse Break Fee (as applicable)
does not apply to the extent of the Break Fee Impugned Amount.
(c)

If the Break Fee or Reverse Break Fee has been paid by Vault or Damstra (as
applicable) and clause 7.5(a) or 7.5(b) applies, the party who received such
amount must reimburse all or the relevant part of that amount (as the case may be)
within 10 Business Days after receipt of a written demand for reimbursement from
the payor.

Ineligible Foreign Shareholders
(a)

Damstra will be under no obligation to issue any New Damstra Shares under this
Scheme to any Ineligible Foreign Shareholder and instead:
(i)

subject to clauses 5.4 and 5.6, Damstra must, on or before the
Implementation Date, issue the New Damstra Shares which would otherwise
be required to be issued to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders under this
Scheme to the Sale Agent;

(ii)

Damstra must procure that as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Implementation Date, the Sale Agent, in consultation with Damstra, sells or
procures the sale of all the New Damstra Shares issued to the Sale Agent
pursuant to clause 5.3(a)(i) in such manner, at such price and on such other
terms as the Sale Agent reasonably determines, and remits to Vault the
proceeds of the sale (after deduction of any applicable brokerage, stamp
duty, currency conversion costs and other costs, taxes and charges)
(Proceeds);

(iii)

promptly after receiving the Proceeds in respect of the sale of all of the New
Damstra Shares referred to in clause 5.3(a)(i), Vault must pay, or procure
the payment, to each Ineligible Foreign Shareholder, of the amount ‘A’
calculated in accordance with the following formula and rounded down to the
nearest cent:
A = (B ÷ C) x D

B = the number of New Damstra Shares that would otherwise have been
issued to that Ineligible Foreign Shareholder had it not been an Ineligible
Foreign Shareholder and which were issued to the Sale Agent;

been issued to all Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and which were issued to

Shareholders which may arise in connection with this clause 5.3.

(c)

Gilbert + Tobin

Vault must make or procure the making of payments to Ineligible Foreign
Shareholders under clause 5.3(a) by (in the absolute discretion of Vault):
(i)

where an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder has, before the Scheme Record
Date, made a valid election in accordance with the requirements of the
Share Registry to receive dividend payments from Vault by electronic funds
transfer to a bank account nominated by the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder,
paying, or procuring the payment of, the relevant amount in Australian
currency by electronic means in accordance with that election;

(ii)

paying, or procuring the payment of, the relevant amount in Australian
currency by electronic means to a bank account nominated by the Ineligible
Foreign Shareholder by an appropriate authority from the Ineligible Foreign
Shareholder to Vault; or

(iii)

dispatching, or procuring the dispatch of, a cheque for the relevant amount
in Australian currency to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder by prepaid post
to their Registered Address (as at the Scheme Record Date), such cheque
being drawn in the name of the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder (or in the case
of joint holders, in accordance with the procedures set out in clause 5.2).

(d)

If Vault receives professional advice that any withholding or other tax is required by
law or by a Government Agency to be withheld from a payment to an Ineligible
Foreign Shareholder, Vault is entitled to withhold the relevant amount before
making the payment to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder (and payment of the
reduced amount shall be taken to be full payment of the relevant amount for the
purposes of this Scheme, including clause 5.3(a)(iii)). Vault must pay any amount
so withheld to the relevant taxation authorities within the time permitted by law,
and, if requested in writing by the relevant Ineligible Foreign Shareholder, provide a
receipt or other appropriate evidence of such payment (or procure the provision of
such receipt or other evidence) to the relevant Ineligible Foreign Shareholder.

(e)

Each Ineligible Foreign Shareholder appoints Vault as its agent to receive on its
behalf any financial services guide (or similar or equivalent document) or other
notices (including any updates of those documents) that the Sale Agent is required
to provide to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders under the Corporations Act or any
other applicable law.

(f)

Payment of the amount calculated in accordance with clause 5.3(a) to an Ineligible
Foreign Shareholder in accordance with this clause 5.3 satisfies in full the Ineligible
Foreign Shareholder’s right to Scheme Consideration.

(g)

If there is any surplus Proceeds, that surplus may be retained by Damstra following
the satisfaction of Vault's obligations under this clause 5.3(a). Any interest on the
Proceeds (less bank fees and other charges) will be to Damstra's account.

(h)

Where the issue of New Damstra Shares to which a Scheme Shareholder would
otherwise be entitled under this Scheme would result in a breach of law or of a
provision of the constitution of Damstra:
(i)

Damstra will issue the maximum possible number of New Damstra Shares to
the Scheme Shareholder without giving rise to such a breach; and

(ii)

any further New Damstra Shares to which that Scheme Shareholder is
entitled, but the issue of which to the Scheme Shareholder would give rise to
such a breach, will instead be issued to the Sale Agent and dealt with under
the preceding provisions in this clause 5.3, as if a reference to Ineligible

3477-9088-1804 v1

Foreign Shareholders also included that Scheme Shareholder and
references to that person’s New Damstra Shares in that clause were limited
to the New Damstra Shares issued to the Sale Agent under this clause.

5.4

Fractional entitlements and splitting
(a)

Where the calculation of the Scheme Consideration to be issued to a particular
Scheme Shareholder would result in the Scheme Shareholder becoming entitled to
a fraction of a cent or of a New Damstra Share, the fractional entitlement will be
rounded down to the nearest whole cent or number of New Damstra Shares, as
applicable.

(b)

If Damstra is of the opinion, formed reasonably, that several Scheme
Shareholders, each of which holds a holding of Vault Shares which results in a
fractional entitlement to New Damstra Shares have, before the Scheme Record
Date, been party to a shareholding splitting or division in an attempt to obtain an
advantage by reference to the rounding provided for in the calculation of each
Scheme Shareholder’s entitlement to the Scheme Consideration, Damstra may
direct Vault to give notice to those Scheme Shareholders:
(ii)

setting out the names and Registered Addresses of all of them;

(iii)

stating that opinion; and

(iv)

attributing to one of them specifically identified in the notice the Vault Shares
held by all of them,

and, after the notice has been so given, the Scheme Shareholder specifically
identified in the notice shall, for the purposes of this Scheme, be taken to hold all
those Vault Shares and each of the other Scheme Shareholders whose names are
set out in the notice shall, for the purposes of this Scheme, be taken to hold no
Vault Shares.
5.5

Unclaimed monies
(a)

5.6

Vault may cancel a cheque issued under this clause 5 if the cheque:
(ii)

is returned to Vault; or

(iii)

has not been presented for payment within six months after the date on
which the cheque was sent.

(a)

During the period of 12 months commencing on the Implementation Date, on
request in writing from a Scheme Shareholder to Vault (or the Share Registry)
(which request may not be made until the date which is 60 Business Days after the
Implementation Date), Vault must reissue a cheque that was previously cancelled
under this clause 5.5.

(b)

The Unclaimed Money Act 1950 (ACT) will apply in relation to any Scheme
Consideration which becomes ‘unclaimed money’ (as defined in section 6 of the
Unclaimed Money Act 1950 (ACT)).

Orders of a court or Government Agency

Registry) of an order or direction made by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another
Government Agency that:

For personal use only

(a)

requires consideration to be provided to a third party (either through payment of a
sum or the issuance of a security) in respect of Scheme Shares held by a particular
Scheme Shareholder, which would otherwise be payable or required to be issued
to that Scheme Shareholder by Vault or Damstra in accordance with this clause 5,
then Vault or Damstra (as applicable) shall be entitled to procure that provision of
that consideration is made in accordance with that order or direction; or

(b)

prevents Vault or Damstra from providing consideration to any particular Scheme
Shareholder in accordance with this clause 5, or the payment or issuance of such
consideration is otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Vault or Damstra shall be
entitled to (as applicable):
(ii)

retain an amount, in Australian dollars, calculated pursuant to clause 5.3(a)
in respect of that Scheme Shareholder; or

(iii)

not to issue (or direct Damstra not to issue), or to issue to a trustee or
nominee, such number of New Damstra Shares as that Scheme Shareholder
would otherwise be entitled to under clause 5.1,

until such time as provision of the Scheme Consideration in accordance with this
clause 5 is permitted by that (or another) order or direction or otherwise by law.
5.7

Status of New Damstra Shares
Subject to this Scheme becoming Effective, Damstra must:

6

Gilbert + Tobin

(a)

issue the New Damstra Shares required to be issued by it under this Scheme on
terms such that each such New Damstra Share will rank equally in all respects with
each existing Damstra Share;

(b)

ensure that each such New Damstra Share is duly and validly issued in
accordance with all applicable laws and Damstra’s constitution, fully paid and free
from any mortgage, charge, lien, encumbrance or other security interest (except for
any lien arising under Damstra’s constitution); and

(c)

use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that such New Damstra Shares are, from
the Business Day following the date this Scheme becomes Effective (or such later
date as ASX requires), quoted for trading on the ASX initially on a deferred
settlement basis and thereafter on an ordinary settlement basis.

Dealings in Vault Shares
6.1

Determination of Scheme Shareholders

alterations to the Share Register will only be recognised if:
(a)

in the case of dealings of the type to be effected using CHESS, the transferee is
registered in the Share Register as the holder of the relevant Vault Shares at or
before the Record Date; and

(b)

in all other cases, registrable transfer or transmission applications in respect of
those dealings, or valid requests in respect of other alterations, are received at or
before the Record Date at the place where the Vault Register is kept,

3477-9088-1804 v1

page | 9

For personal use only

and Vault must not accept for registration, nor recognise for any purpose (except a
transfer to Damstra pursuant to this Scheme and any subsequent transfer by Damstra or
its successors in title), any transfer or transmission application or other request received
after the Record Date, or received prior to the Record Date but not in registrable or
actionable form.
6.2

Gilbert + Tobin

Share Register
(a)

Vault must register registrable transmission applications or transfers of Vault
Shares in accordance with clause 6.1(b) at or before the Record Date, provided
that nothing in this clause 6.2(a) requires Vault to register a transfer that would
result in a Vault Shareholder holding a parcel of Vault Shares that is less than a
‘marketable parcel’ (as defined in the operating rules of ASX).

(b)

If this Scheme becomes Effective, a Scheme Shareholder (and any person
claiming through that Scheme Shareholder) must not dispose of, or purport or
agree to dispose of, any Scheme Shares or any interest in them after the Record
Date otherwise than pursuant to this Scheme, and any attempt to do so will have
no effect and Vault will be entitled to disregard any such disposal, purported
disposal or agreement.

(c)

For the purpose of determining entitlements to the Scheme Consideration, Vault
must maintain the Share Register in accordance with the provisions of this clause
6.2 until the Scheme Consideration has been paid to the Scheme Shareholders.
The Share Register in this form will solely determine entitlements to the Scheme
Consideration.

(d)

All statements of holding for Vault Shares (other than statements of holding in
favour of Damstra) will cease to have effect after the Record Date as documents of
title in respect of those shares and, as from that date, each entry current at that
date on the Share Register (other than entries in respect of Damstra) will cease to
have effect except as evidence of entitlement to the Scheme Consideration in
respect of the Vault Shares relating to that entry.

(e)

As soon as possible after the Record Date, and in any event by 5:00pm on the first
Business Day after the Record Date, Vault will ensure that details of the names,
Registered Addresses and holdings of Vault Shares for each Scheme Shareholder
as shown in the Share Register as at the Record Date are available to Damstra in
the form Damstra reasonably requires.

Quotation of Vault Shares
(a)

Vault will apply to ASX to suspend trading in Vault Shares with effect from the
close of trading on the Effective Date.

(b)

Vault must apply:
(i)

for termination of the official quotation of Vault Shares on the ASX; and

(ii)

to have itself removed from the official list of ASX,

in each case with effect on and from the close of trading on the trading day
immediately following the Implementation Date.
