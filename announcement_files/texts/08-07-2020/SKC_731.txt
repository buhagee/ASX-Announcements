8 July 2020
SkyCity $50 Million Share Purchase Plan Receives Strong Support
SkyCity Entertainment Group Limited (NZX/ASX:SKC) ("SkyCity") is pleased to announce
that its $50 million share purchase plan ("SPP"), which closed on 3 July 2020, received
strong shareholder support with total applications of approximately $45.6 million
(a 91% take-up).
The SPP was part of SkyCity’s funding plan and equity raising announced on 17 June 2020,
which also included a $180 million institutional placement. The SPP was open to all
eligible existing SkyCity shareholders with a registered address in New Zealand or
Australia, enabling them to each subscribe for up to a maximum of NZ$50,000/A$47,000
of new SkyCity shares.
The new shares under the SPP will be issued at a price of NZ$2.38 (A$2.24), being a 2.5%
discount to the five-day volume weighted average price of SkyCity’s shares traded on the
NZX during the last five days of the SPP offer period (including the closing date), rounded
down to the nearest cent.
The SPP was fully underwritten and the shortfall (approximately $4.4 million) will be
allocated to existing shareholders (as sub-underwriters) as arranged by the underwriters.
Settlement of the SPP and allotment of the new shares is expected to occur on 9 July
2020, with trading of NZX shares commencing on 9 July 2020 and ASX shares on 10 July
2020. The new shares to be issued under the SPP will rank equally in all respects with
SkyCity’s existing ordinary shares.
