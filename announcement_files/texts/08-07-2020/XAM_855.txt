Mineral Resources are classified according to CIM Guidelines .
Mineral Resources for open pit mining are estimated within the limits of an ultimate pit shell.
A cut-off grade of 0.3% CuEq has been applied for open pit resources.
Density values of 2.65 t/m3 for oxide zones; 2.76, 2.74, 2.73 and 2.71 t/m3 for country rocks, 2.78, 2.80 2.77, 2.81 and 2.76 t/m3 for porphyries and 2.76 t/m3 for
andesite dyke were used for the model cells.
CuEq – copper equivalent was calculated using conversion factor 0.62097 for gold. Metal prices used were 3.1 $/lb for copper and 1320 $/oz for gold, recoveries – 70%
for gold and 85% for copper (82.35% relative gold to copper recovery), copper equivalent formula applied: CuEq = Cu + Au * 0.62097 * 0.8235.

Competent Person’s Statement

Page 27

The Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore
Reserves (the ‘JORC Code 2012’) sets out minimum standards, recommendations and
guidelines for Public Reporting in Australasia of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and
Ore Reserves. The Information contained in this announcement has been presented in
accordance with the JORC Code 2012.

The information in this announcement that relates to Mineral Resources is based on
information compiled by Dmitry Pertel who is responsible for the Mineral Resource
estimate. Mr Pertel is a full-time employee of CSA Global and is a Member of the Australian
Institute of Geoscientists, has sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation
and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity he is undertaking to qualify as
the “Qualified Person” as defined in the CIM Guidelines and National Instrument 43-101. Mr
Pertel consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on this information in the
form and context in which it appears.

The information in this report that relates to the Scoping Study is based, and fairly reflects,
information compiled by Gordon Zurowski, P.Eng is a registered Professional Engineer in
Ontario, Canada. Mr Zurowski is employed by CSA Global, independent resource industry
consultants. Mr Zurowski has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of
mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is
undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the
‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore
Reserves’. Mr Zurowski consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on his
information in the form and context in which it appears.

The information in this announcement that relates to metallurgical test work is based on a
summary of results compiled by Andrew Holloway who is responsible for metallurgical and
process engineering aspects of the project. Mr. Holloway, who is a principal of AGP Mining
Consultants Inc. (Toronto, Canada) and is a Professional Engineer in Ontario, Canada, has
sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under
consideration and to the activity he is undertaking to qualify as the “Competent Person” as
defined in the 2012 Edition of the “Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results,
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves” and the National Instrument 43-101. Mr Holloway
consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on this information in the form
and context in which it appears.

The information in this announcement that relates to exploration results is based on
information compiled by Dr Andrew Stewart who is responsible for the exploration data,
comments on exploration target sizes, QA/QC and geological interpretation and information.
Dr Stewart, who is an employee of Xanadu and is a Member of the Australasian Institute of
