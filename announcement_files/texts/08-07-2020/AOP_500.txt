Update on Acquisition of Minority Interest in Bagoe and Liberty
da

Exore Resources Ltd (‘Exore’ or the ‘Company’ | ASX: ERX) is pleased to announce that further to
the ASX announcement on 3 June 2020 and under the Joint Venture Agreement with Apollo
Consolidated Ltd (‘Apollo’), Exore has made a payment of US$4.5 million to Apollo to acquire the
remaining 20% joint venture interest in the Bagoe and Liberty Projects in northern Côte d’Ivoire.
Exore exercised its Pre-Emptive Right over Apollo’s minority interest to acquire 100% of both
projects.
As announced on 3 June 2020, under a proposed Scheme of Arrangement (‘Scheme’), Perseus
Mining Limited (‘Perseus’) is to acquire 100% of Exore in an all-share transaction under which, if
implemented, Exore shareholders will receive 1 Perseus share for every 12.79 Exore shares held. The
Scheme is conditional upon (among other conditions precedent) the 20% interest in the Bagoe and
Liberty Projects referred to above being transferred to or becoming held for Exore.
Following this acquisition payment, Exore’s current cash position is approximately A$4.9 million.
