DESANE EXPANDS ITS BRISBANE INDUSTRIAL ASSET
Desane Properties Pty Ltd, a controlled entity of Desane Group Holdings Limited (ASX: DGH)
(Desane), wishes to announce that it has lodged a compliant Development Application with Brisbane
City Council, to expand its existing industrial property asset located in the Brisbane suburb of Wacol.
The proposed additional facility will add an additional 3,250m2 of net lettable floor space to the
existing 5,039m2 facility, creating a total of 8,298m2 of net lettable area.

Subject to Council approval and pre‐lease of the proposed 3,250m2 facility, construction is
anticipated to commence early 2021. On completion, the combined facilities should generate over
$1.0m per annum of net rental income for the Group.

Desane purchased the 21,750m2 industrial asset in November 2019. The existing facility is leased to
the Brisbane City Council and serves as their vehicle and fleet maintenance headquarters.
Managing Director, Phil Montrone, said “the appointment by Desane of Sparc Architects and Place
Design Group, to incorporate the new logistics centre with the existing facility, will deliver a product
that is contextually relevant and will meet local demand for urban service space.”
“This project aligns with Desane’s vision to grow sustainable, reliable, income producing assets that
benefit its shareholders” the Managing Director said.
Further updates will become available as the application progresses.
