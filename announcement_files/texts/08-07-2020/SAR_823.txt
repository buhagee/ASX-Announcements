Saracen Mineral Holdings (ASX: SAR) is pleased to announce record production and cash flow for the year to 30 June 2020. Group
gold production of 520,414oz for FY20 was ahead of guidance of +500,000oz.
In response to COVID-19, Saracen flagged the potential to prioritise the milling of higher grade portions of the stockpiles at Carosue
Dam and Thunderbox in the June quarter (see March quarterly report, 28 April 2020). However, COVID-19 ultimately had a limited
impact on the business and therefore this plan was not implemented and Saracen continued to execute its long-standing ‘futureproof the business’ strategy.
Managing Director Raleigh Finlayson said the results reflected Saracen’s ongoing success in meeting or exceeding guidance and in
generating growth. “We have now met or exceeded guidance for seven straight financial years,” he said. “We are also meeting our
undertakings to continue driving growth and we expect this to be clearly evident in our strong news flow over the coming months.”
This news flow will include the June quarter report, Carosue Dam and Thunderbox update, FY20 financial results, and KCGM update.
Each update will include drill results, Resources and Reserves, and production and cost outlook.
