Binding Sale and Purchase Agreement with Black Cat Syndicate Limited
(ASX: BC8) and Newmont Corporation Limited
Agreement covers the Yarri East Joint Venture tenements (formerly known
as the Yindarlgooda Joint Venture) near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia
Consideration (RBR’s share) is $98,000 cash plus a Net Smelter Royalty
(NSR) of 0.49% of all future minerals produced

RBR Group Limited (“RBR” or “the Company”) advises that it has entered into a binding Sale and
Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) with Black Cat Syndicate Limited (“BC8”) and a subsidiary of
Newmont Corporation Limited (“Newmont”), for BC8 to acquire 100% of the Yarri East Joint Venture
(“Yarri East”) near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia – tenements E27/600, E27/456, E27/449 and E27/431.
The Yarri East tenements are held in a Joint Venture between RBR (49% interest) and Newmont (51%
interest).
Acquisition terms for Yarri East include a cash consideration of $200,000 ($98,000 to RBR) and 1.0%
Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) of which RBR’s share is 0.49%. BC8 also assumes responsibility for all
environmental liabilities and approvals regarding the transfer of the tenements.
The sale of the JV interests completes the disposal of all exploration interests of RBR in WA, removing
all residual tenement holdings, maintenance and environmental commitments.
The cash proceeds, together with a further $48,702 in Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) rebates related
to the COVID-19 pandemic government incentives, as well as the previously announced reduction and/or
deferment in director remuneration has resulted in a working capital boost of approximately $200,000.
