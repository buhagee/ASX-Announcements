ERA produced 377 tonnes of uranium oxide in the June 2020 quarter compared to
421 tonnes in the March 2020 quarter.
Production for the June 2020 quarter was lower than the March 2020 quarter due to
the favourable drawdown of work in progress stocks that occurred in that prior quarter.
While production for the June quarter was favourably impacted by higher milling rates,
this was largely offset by lower mill recovery. Mill head grade remained consistent
with the March 2020 quarter.

For personal use only

In accordance with the Company’s mine plan, continued uranium production is based
on the processing of primary ore stockpiles, applying a declining grade strategy.
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ERA continues to maintain controls
and protocols in accordance with the Company’s COVID-19 Management Plan to
protect our employees and local communities as our first priority and ensure full
compliance with Government requirements. On 5 June 2020, the Commonwealth
Government lifted the Biosecurity Determination applicable to the West Arnhem
region, permitting unrestricted travel between Darwin and Jabiru (and therefore the
Ranger mine).
At this point in time, operations at Ranger are continuing and there is no change in the
Company’s production guidance for 2020 of 1,200 to 1,600 tonnes of uranium oxide.
ERA is monitoring all COVID-19 developments and will provide further updates to the
extent there is any material impact on Ranger operations.
RANGER REHABILITATION
Progressive rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area continued to focus on the
dredges transferring tailings from the Tailings Storage Facility to Pit 3. In addition, the
back fill of Pit 1 continues and remains on track to be completed in the second half of
2020, at which time revegetation works will commence.
The productivity of the Company’s dredging operations was constrained during the
quarter due to ongoing interstate travel restrictions in place as a result of the COVID19 pandemic and lower process water volumes. The resulting impact to the Ranger
rehabilitation program, if any, will be further evaluated during the second half of 2020.
EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION
No evaluation or exploration expenditure was incurred for the June 2020 quarter, in
line with the March 2020 quarter.
The Ranger 3 Deeps Exploration Decline remains under care and maintenance.
