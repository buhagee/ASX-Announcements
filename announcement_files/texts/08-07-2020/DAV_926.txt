DAVENPORT ANNOUNCES PLACEMENT FOLLOWING SUCCESS
OF SPP

Further to the announcement of the completion of the Share Purchase Plan (“SPP”), (ASX announcement 3 July 2020)
where shareholders supported the Company with funds totaling $547,000, the Board of Directors of Davenport
Resources Limited (ASX:DAV) (“Davenport” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that additional interest from
AFSL, Directors and sophistical investors has raised a further $325,000 through a placement (the “Placement”) which
is to be allotted within Davenport’s entitlement under ASX Listing Rule 7.1. The participation in the offering by Directors
is subject to shareholder approval at the AGM.
The new shares under the Placement will be issued on or around 13 July 2020 with holding statements expected to
be dispatched to participants on or around 13 July 2020.
The Company has now successfully raised $872,000 between the Placement and the SPP, which is substantially
above the original target of $750,000 for the SPP. The Company would like to thank shareholders for their participation
in the successful SPP and also those who participated in the Placement.
This announcement has been approved by the Board of Directors of Davenport Resources Limited.
