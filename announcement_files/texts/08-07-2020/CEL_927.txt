CEL makes new gold discovery at its Hualilan Project
which is expected to substantially increase scale
Highlights
▪

Drill hole GNDD-025, located in the Gap Zone between Cerro Sur and Cerro Norte, 300
metres along strike from prior CEL drilling, has returned (refer Table 1):

•

50m at 1.4 g/t gold, 3.4 g/t silver in altered dacite porphyry which remains open
with assays pending, including a higher-grade zone in oxides of

•

37 metres at 1.8 g/t gold, 4.2 g/t silver from 53 metres

▪

This is a new type of mineralisation hosted in dacite porphyry with significant tonnage
potential. The historical mineralisation at Hualilan occurs in faults or limestone units

▪

A conceptual, near surface, target covering 1-kilometre in strike, up to 100 metres wide, has
been defined by historical drilling and altered surface exposure

▪

Whilst the high-grade mineralisation remains the focus, CEL is now extending exploration
to this dacite porphyry given it is adjacent to the historical higher-grade mineralisation

▪

Drill hole GNDD-051 (assays pending) was completed to test this conceptual target and
successfully intersected altered dacite under cover from 69 metres to the end of hole

▪

The recently completed IP Survey conducted at Cerro Norte shows an interpreted dacite
intrusion of significant scale underlying the mineralisation

▪

GNDD-047,GNDD-052, and GNDD-053 (assays pending) have intersected significant widths
to the end of hole of strongly altered dacite porphyry at Sentazon over 1.5 km south of
GNDD-025, and outside the conceptual target

▪

As this new discovery in dacite intrusives is contiguous to, and underlies, the existing highgrade mineralisation it will have significant synergies from a mine development perspective

Commenting on the results, CEL Managing Director, Mr Kris Knauer, said
“We are excited by this development at our flagship Hualilan Gold Project. Whilst the high-grade
mineralisation will remain the Company’s main focus, uncovering a new, large-tonnage target, which is
expected to substantially increase scale significantly enhances the project and adds to its robust nature.”
“In the context of what now appears to be extensive near-surface high-grade historical mineralisation at
Cerro Norte, the discovery of 37 metres of oxide material grading 1.8 g/t gold, over a potential strike length
of 1 kilometre, is material and we simply cannot ignore the optionality to quickly add significant ounces to
the project”

ASX Release

For personal use only

8 July 2020

Challenger Exploration (ASX: CEL) (“CEL” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the discovery of
a new style of Intrusion-hosted gold mineralisation contiguous to the Company's Hualilan Gold Project,
located in San Juan Province Argentina.
Drill hole GNDD-025 intersected 50m at 1.4 g/t gold, 3.4 g/t silver, 0.15 % lead and 0.17 % zinc from
53 metres, under cover in dacite porphyry containing weak iron oxide, silica, and pyrite alteration. The
intercept remains open at depth, with the hole intersecting 93 metres of, and ending in, altered
porphyry dacite. Assays are pending for the lower 38 metres from 103 metres to 141 metres, and end
of hole.
The hole is located in the Gap Zone between Cerro Norte and Cerro Sur, 300 metres along strike from
any prior CEL drilling. It was drilled as a wildcat test of this largely unexplored 1 kilometre of strike,
between the historical mineralisation in Cerro Sur and Cerro Norte, and to follow up on a vertical drill
hole, completed in 1984, which was only partially sampled but returned 18.7m at 0.72 g/t gold and
1.5 g/t silver in dacite (0.2 g/t Au cut-off).
The high-grade skarn target remains a priority in this 1 kilometre zone, having been mapped in outcrop
in the southern 500 metres of this zone at Pizzaro and Puntilla, and is believed to have been shifted
some 200 metres to the east by the Magnata and Sanchez faults.
The top of the intercept includes a higher grade zone of 37 metres at 1.8 g/t gold, 4.2 g/t silver down
to the base of oxidation which occurs at 90 metres downhole, which is potentially related to supergene
enrichment. In the context of extensive near-surface high-grade skarn mineralisation at Cerro Norte,
with higher grades at the top of the intercept, over a potential kilometer of strike, it may significantly
increase the quantum of mineralisation. Particularly given this intercept is near surface and covered
by recent unconsolidated alluvial gravel.

ASX Release

For personal use only

8 July 2020

The Company awaits the assays for the remainder of the hole and notes that individual 1-2 metre
splits in the 13 metres of fresh porphyry dacite returned assays over 1 g/t gold with two one metre
splits in the bottom four metres of the zone assayed returning 0.7 g/t gold and 0.9 g/t gold.
Conceptual Target
Following the receipt of the assays for the top half of GNDD-025, a review of the project data has
defined a conceptual target covering 1 kilometre of strike, and up to 100 metres wide (Figure 1 on the
previous page). This is defined by the limited historical drilling, mapping of the surface exposure of the
altered dacite porphyries, and recent CEL drill holes.
The southern end of the target is defined by CEL drill holes GNDD-031 and GNDD-032 (assays pending)
and CEL drill hole GNDD-010 (previously announced). GNDD-032 intersected 156 metres of porphyritic
dacite with disseminated pyrite and iron-oxide ± sericite alteration from 10 metres until the end of
the hole at 166 metres while GNDD-031 intersected 25 metres of porphyritic dacite from 125 metres
to the end of the hole. CEL drill hole GNDD-010 intersected 27 metres at 0.28 g/t gold, 8.4 g/t silver
in weakly sericite altered dacite well above the main high-grade skarn intersection of 3 metres at 17.7
g/t gold, 143 g/t silver, 2.5% zinc from 139 metres downhole.
Drill hole GNDD-051 (assays spending) was recently completed to test this conceptual target 100
metres south of GNDD-021 (Figure 2). The hole successfully intersected 51 metres of altered and
brecciated dacite from the base of cover at 69m to the end of the hole, exhibiting very similar geology
and alteration (pyrite-sericite) to that intersected in GNDD-025. Comparable to GNDD-025, the
porphyry dacite was covered by unconsolidated gravel. Logging, sampling and assaying, for this hole
will be fast tracked. Drilling is also proposed to follow up GNDD-025 and GNDD-051.
Broader Potential of Intrusion-hosted gold mineralisation
CEL notes historical reports of "zones of gold within quartz stockworking and brecciation within dacite
porphyry which are possible large-tonnage targets (1)" at Hualilan. San Juan also hosts a number of
world class gold-copper porphyry ore bodies. The company is currently sampling, for assay, all
intervals of dacite intersected in its current 51 drill holes. A number of the Company's drill holes have
intersected porphyry dacite adjacent to the higher-grade skarn mineralisation. Some CEL holes were
terminated in porphyry dacite prior to it being recognised as a potentially important target.
Significant potential exists beyond the immediate 1 kilometer long conceptual target. Figure 2 and 3
(over the page) show the distribution of the dacite in the current geological model which is constrained
by a lack of data. The recently acquired IP data (superimposed in Figure 2) is interpreted as showing
a major dacite intrusion at depth below Cerro Norte.
Further specific examples of the potential of the for Intrusion-hosted gold mineralisation beyond the
immediate 1 kilometer long target include:
▪

CEL drill holes GNDD-047, GNDD-052 and GNDD-053 which are located at Sentazon a further
700m south along strike from the conceptual target. These holes intersected significant
widths to the end of hole of strongly sericite-chlorite-pyrite altered dacite porphyry

ASX Release
8 July 2020

About Challenger Exploration
Challenger Exploration Limited's(ASX: CEL) aspiration is to become a globally significant gold producer.
The Company is developing two complementary gold/copper projects in South America. The strategy
for the Hualilan Gold project is for it to provide a high-grade low capex operation in the near term.
This underpins CEL with a low risk, high margin source of cashflow while it prepares for a much larger
bulk gold operation in Ecuador.
1. Hualilan Gold Project, located in San Juan Province Argentina, is a near term development
opportunity. It has extensive historical drilling with over 150 drill-holes and a non-JORC
historical resource (2) of 627,000 Oz @ 13.7 g/t gold which remains open in most directions.
The project was locked up in a dispute for the past 15 years and as a consequence had seen
no modern exploration until CEL acquired the project in 2019. Results from CEL's first drilling
program included (A) 6.1m @ 34.6 g/t Au, 21.9 g/t Ag, 2.9% Zn, 6.7m @ 14.3 g/t Au, 140 g/t
Ag, 7.3% Zn and 10.3m @ 10.4 g/t Au, 28 g/t Ag, 4.6% Zn. This drilling intersected high-grade
gold over almost 2 kilometres of strike and extended the known mineralisation along strike
and at depth in multiple locations. CEL's 2020 program will include 7,500 metres of drilling,
metallurgical test work of key ore types, and an initial JORC Compliant Resource which will
allow an economic review.
2. El Guayabo Project covers 35 sqkms in southern Ecuador and was last drilled by Newmont
Mining in 1995 and 1997 targeting gold in hydrothermal breccias. Historical drilling has
demonstrated potential to host significant gold and associated copper and silver
mineralisation. Historical drilling has returned a number of intersections of plus 100m of
intrusion related breccia and vein hosted mineralisation. The Project has multiple targets
including breccia hosted mineralization, an extensive flat lying late stage vein system and an
underlying porphyry system target neither of which has been drill tested. CEL's first results
confirm the discovery of large-scale gold system with over 250 metres of bulk gold
mineralisation encountered in drill hole ZK-02 which contains a significant high-grade core of
134 metres at 1.0 g/t gold and 4.1 g/t silver including 63 metres at 1.6 g/t gold and 5.1 g/t
silver.

-

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done
this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg
was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In
other cases, more explanation may be required, such as
where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types
(eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of
detailed information.

Commentary
For historic exploration data, there is little information provided by previous explorers to detail sampling
techniques. Drill core was cut with a diamond saw longitudinally and one half submitted for assay. Assay
was generally done for Au. In some drill campaigns, Ag and Zn were also analysed. There is limited
multielement data available. No information is available for RC drill techniques and sampling.
For CEL drilling, diamond core (HQ3) was cut longitudinally on site using a diamond saw. Samples lengths
are from 0.5m to 2.0m in length (average 1m), taken according to lithology, alteration, and mineralization
contacts.
For CEL reverse circulation (RC) drilling, 2-4 kg sub-samples from each 1m drilled are collected from a
face sample recovery cyclone mounted on the drill machine.
Core samples were crushed to approximately 85% passing 2mm. A 500g or a 1 kg sub-sample was taken
and pulverized to 85% passing 75µm. A 50g charge was analysed for Au by fire assay with AA
determination. Where the fire assay grade is > 10 g/t gold, a 50g charge was analysed for Au by Fire
assay with gravimetric determination.
A 10g charge was analysed for 48 elements by 4-acid digest and ICP-MS determination. Elements
determined were Ag, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb,
Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, S, Sb Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn and Zr.
Ag > 100 g/t, Zn, Pb and Cu > 10,000 ppm and S > 10% were re-analysed by the same method using a
different calibration.
Sample intervals were selected according to geological boundaries. There was no coarse gold observed
in any of the core.

Drilling techniques

-

Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).

Collar details for diamond core drilling (DD) and reverse circulation (RC) historic drilling campaigns is
provided below from archival data cross checked with drill logs and available plans and sections where
available. Collars shown below are in WGS84, zone 19s which is the standard projection used by CEL for
the Project. Collar locations have been check surveyed using differential GPS (DGPS) by CEL to verify if
the site coincides with a marked collar or tagged drill site. In most cases the drill collars coincide with
historic drill site, some of which (but not all) are tagged. The collar check surveys were reported in
POSGAR (2007) projection and converted to WGS84.

CEL drilling of HQ3 core (triple tube) was done using a LM90 truck mounted drill machine that is operated
by Foraco Argentina S.A. (Mendoza) and a trailer mounted Hydrocore drill machine operated by Energold
Drilling (Mendoza). The core has not been oriented.
CEL drilling of reverse circulation (RC) drill holes is being done using a track-mounted LM650 universal
drill rig set up for reverse circulation drilling. Drilling is being done using a 5.5 inch hammer bit.
Collar details for DD drill holes and RC drill holes completed by CEL are shown below in WGS84, zone 19s
projection. Collar locations for drill holes to GNDD010 are surveyed using DGPS. Collar location for holes
from GNDD011 are surveyed with a handheld GPS to be followed up with DGPS in the near future.

Drill core is placed into wooden boxes by the drillers and depth marks are indicated on wooden blocks at
the end of each run. These depths are reconciled by CEL geologists when measuring core recovery.
Triple tube drilling has been being done by CEL to maximise core recovery.
RC sub-samples are collected from a rotary splitter mounted to the face sample recovery cyclone. A 2-4
kg sub-samples is collected for each metre of RC drilling. Duplicate samples are taken at the rate of I
every 25-30 samples using a riffle splitter to split out a 2-4 kg sub-sample. The whole sample recovered is
weighed to measure sample recovery and consistency in sampling.

Commentary
A possible relationship has been observed between historic sample recovery and Au Ag or Zn grade
whereby low recoveries have resulted in underreporting of grade. Insufficient information is not yet
available to more accurately quantify this. Core recovery is influenced by the intensity of natural
fracturing in the rock. A positive correlation between recovery and RQD has been observed. The
fracturing is generally post mineral and not directly associated with the mineralisation.

Whether core and chip samples have been geologically
and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support
appropriate Mineral Resource estimation mining studies
and metallurgical studies.
Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature.
Core (or costean channel etc) photography.
The total length and percentage of the relevant
intersections logged.

Detailed logs are available for most of the historical drilling. Some logs have not been recovered. No
core photographs from the historic drilling have been found. No drill core has survived due to poor
storage and neglect. No RC sample chips have been found.

If core whether cut or sawn and whether quarter half or
all core taken.
If non-core whether riffled tube sampled rotary split etc
and whether sampled wet or dry.
For all sample types the nature quality and
appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.
Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling

Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is
representative of the in-situ material collected including
for instance results for field duplicate/second-half

For CEL drilling, all the core is logged for recovery RQD weathering lithology alteration mineralization and
structure to a level that is suitable for geological modelling resource estimation and metallurgical test
work. RC drill chips are logged for geology, alteration and mineralisation. Where possible logging is
quantitative. Geological logging is done in MS Excel in a format that can readily be transferred to a
database which holds all drilling logging sample and assay data.

Sample intervals are selected based on lithology alteration and mineralization boundaries. Sample
lengths average 1.16m. No second-half core samples have been submitted. The second half of the core
samples has been retained in the core trays for future reference.
RC sub-samples are collected at the drill site. A duplicate RC sample is collected for every 25-30m drilled.
CEL samples have been submitted to the MSA laboratory in San Juan and the ALS laboratory in Mendoza
for sample preparation. The sample preparation technique is considered appropriate for the style of
mineralization present in the Project.
Sample sizes are appropriate for the mineralisation style and grain size of the deposit.
The MSA laboratory used for sample preparation in San Juan has been inspected by Stuart Munroe
(Exploration Manager) and Sergio Rotondo (COO) prior to any samples being submitted. The laboratory
procedures are consistent with international best practice and are suitable for samples from the Project.
The ALS laboratory in Mendoza has not yet been inspected by CEL representatives.
Internal laboratory standards were used for each job to ensure correct calibration of elements.
CEL submit blank samples (cobble and gravel material from a quarry nearby to Las Flores San Yuan) to
both the MSA laboratory and the ALS laboratory which were strategically placed in the sample sequence
immediately after samples that were suspected of containing high grade Au Ag Zn or Cu to test the lab

accuracy of the analytic procedures and determination of the MSA laboratory in Canada. 22 reference
samples were analysed in the samples submitted in 2019. For CRM 1 one sample returned an Au value >
2 standard deviations (SD) above the certified value. For CRM 2 one sample returned an Au value < 2SD
below the certified value. For CRM 3 one sample returned a Cu value > 2SD above the certified value. All
other analyses are within 2SD of the expected value. The standards demonstrate suitable precision and
accuracy of the analytic process. No systematic bias is observed.
For drill holes from GNDD011 onwards three different Certified Standard Reference pulp samples (CRM)
with known values for Au Ag Fe S Pb Cu and Zn have been submitted with samples of drill core to test the
precision and accuracy of the analytic procedures and determination of the ALS Laboratory in Canada. In
the results received to date 30 CRM standards have been received from ALS Laboratory. In all cased the
values returned have been within +/- 2SD of the mean value. The standards demonstrate suitable
precision and accuracy of the analytic process. No systematic bias is observed.

Repeat sampling of 186 coarse reject samples from 2019 drilling has been done to verify sampling.
Original samples were from the 2019 DD drilling which were analysed by MSA (San Juan preparation and
Vancouver analysis). Repeat samples were analysed by ALS (Mendoza preparation and Vancouver
analysis). The repeat analysis technique was identical to the original. The repeat analyses correlate very
closely with the original analyses providing a high confidence in the sample preparation and analysis from
MSA and ALS. A summary of the results for the 186 sample pairs for key elements is provided below:

geology and sampling are currently being compiled and digitised as are sample data geological mapping trench
data adit exposures and drill hole results. Geophysical surveys exist but have largely yet to be check located and
digitised.
Drilling on the Hualilan Project (Cerro Sur and Cerro Norte combined) extends to over 150 drill holes. The key
historical exploration drilling and sampling results are listed below.
1984 – Lixivia SA channel sampling & 16 RC holes (AG1-AG16) totaling 2040m
1995 - Plata Mining Limited (TSE: PMT) 33 RC holes (Hua- 1 to 33) + 1500 samples
1998 – Chilean consulting firm EPROM (on behalf of Plata Mining) systematic underground mapping and
channel sampling
1999 – Compania Mineral El Colorado SA (“CMEC”) 59 core holes (DDH-20 to 79) plus 1700m RC
program
2003 – 2005 – La Mancha (TSE Listed) undertook 7447m of DDH core drilling (HD-01 to HD-48)
Detailed resource estimation studies were undertaken by EPROM Ltda. (EPROM) in 1996 and CMEC
(1999 revised 2000) both of which were written to professional standards and La Mancha 2003 and
2006.
The collection of all exploration data by the various operators was of a high standard and had
appropriate sampling techniques intervals and custody procedures were used.
Mineralisation occurs in all rock types but it preferentially replaces limestone shale and sandstone and occurs in
fault zones.

Geology

-

Deposit type geological setting and style of
mineralisation.

The mineralisation has previously been classified as a Zn-Cu distal skarn (or manto-style skarn) with vein-hosted
Au-Ag mineralisation. It has been divided into three phases – prograde skarn retrograde skarn and a late quartz–
galena event the evolution of the hydrothermal system and mineral paragenesis is the subject of more detailed
geometallurgical work.
Gold occurs in native form in tellurides (hessite) and as inclusions with pyrite and chalcopyrite. The
mineralisation also commonly contains chalcopyrite sphalerite and galena.
Mineralisation is either parallel to bedding in bedding-parallel faults or in east-west striking steeply dipping
siliceous quartz-dominated veins that cross the bedding at a high angle. The veins have thicknesses of 1–4 m and
contain abundant sulphides. The intersection between the bedding-parallel mineralisation and east-striking
cross veins seems to be important in localising the mineralisation.

In reporting Exploration Results weighting averaging
techniques maximum and/or minimum grade
truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off
grades are usually Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths
of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade
results the procedure used for such aggregation should
be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.

These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to
the drill hole angle is known its nature should be
reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported there should be a clear statement to this
effect (eg ‘down hole length true width not known’).

The mineralisation is moderately or steeply dipping and strikes strike NNE and ENE. There is insufficient
information in most cases to confidently establish the true width of the mineralized intersections at this stage of
the exploration program.
Apparent widths may be thicker in the case where bedding-parallel mineralisation may intersect ENE-striking
cross faults and veins.
Cross section diagrams have been provided with release of significan intersections to allow estimation of true
widths from individual drill intercepts.

Criteria

Database integrity

Commentary

Measures taken to ensure that data has not been corrupted by for
example transcription or keying errors between its initial collection and
its use for Mineral Resource estimation purposes.
Data validation procedures used.

Geological logging completed by previous explorers was done on paper copies and transcribed into
the drill hole database. The data was checked for errors. Checks can be made against the original
logs and core photographs.
Assay data is received in digital format. Backup copies are kept and the data is copied into the drill
hole database.

Site visits

Geological
interpretation

-

Comment on any site visits undertaken by the Competent Person and
the outcome of those visits.
If no site visits have been undertaken indicate why this is the case.
Confidence in (or conversely the uncertainty of) the geological
interpretation of the mineral deposit.
Nature of the data used and of any assumptions made.
The effect if any of alternative interpretations on Mineral Resource
estimation.
The use of geology in guiding and controlling Mineral Resource
estimation.
The factors affecting continuity both of grade and geology.

The drill hole data is backed up and is updated periodically by a Company GIS and data team.
Site visits have been undertaken from 3 to 16 October 2019 15 to 30 November 2019 and 1-19
February 2020. The performance of the drilling program collection of data and sampling procedures
were initiated during these visits.
The interpretation is considered appropriate given the stage of the project and the nature of
activities that have been conducted. The interpretation captures the essential geometry of the
mineralised structure and lithologies with drill data supporting the findings from the initial
underground sampling activities.
The most recent resource calculation (2006 and 2003 – La Mancha) used all core drilling at the time
and detailed underground channel sampling collected by EPROM CMEC and La Mancha. Overlying
assumptions included a reduction of the calculated grade in each resource block by a factor of 10% to
account for possible errors in the analyses and samples. An arbitrary reduction factor was applied to
the 2006 resource whereby the net reported tonnage was reduced by 25% for indicated resource
blocks 50% for inferred resource blocks and 75% of potential mineral resource blocks. The reason for
the application of these tonnage reduction factors was not outlined in the resource report. It is noted
that at the time of this report La Mancha was in a legal dispute concerning the project with its joint
venture partner and given the acquisition of a 200000 Oz per annum producing portfolio the project
was likely no longer a core asset for La Mancha at that time. Additionally under the original
acquisition agreement La Mancha had to issue additional acquisition shares based on resource
targets.
The effect of removing the assumptions relating to application of the arbitrary tonnage reduction
factors applied increases the overall resource tonnage by in excess of 50%. Removing these
correction factors would bring the overall tonnage and grade close the earlier (2003 1999 and 1996)

The structure of the area is complex and a detailed structural interpretation is recommended as this
may provide a better understanding of the continuity of mineralisation and possible extensions to it.
The deposit contains bonanza gold values and while very limited twinning has indicated acceptable
repeatability a rigorous study of grade continuity needs to be undertaken as part of future resource
calculations.
For the historic resource no reliable information has been provided to the owner however through
further ongoing investigation is being conducted by the owner to address this information gap.
The historic resource estimation techniques are considered appropriate. The 2003 and 2006
resources used a longitudinal section polygonal method was used for estimating resources with
individual blocs representing weighted averages of sampled underground and/or areas of diamond
drill pierce points with zones of influence halfway to adjacent holes. The area of the block was
calculated in AutoCad directly from the longitudinal sections.
Check assaying by PG Consulting returned values in the check assay sample which were 3.4% and
13% greater for Au and Ag than the original assays. A number pf previous resource estimates were
available to check the 2006 resource estimate when the arbitrary tonnage reduction factors are
removed brings the overall tonnage and grade close the earlier (2003 1999 and 1996) tonnage and
grade estimates albeit indifferent categories which are considered more appropriate.
It was assumed only gold silver and zinc would be recovered and that no other by products would be
recovered. This is viewed as conservative given metallurgical data pointing to the production of a
salable zinc concentrate.
Based on the preliminary metallurgy estimation of deleterious elements or other non-grade variables
of economic significance was not required.
The minimum mining width of 0.8m was assumed for veins less than 0.6m and for wider widths a
dilution of 0.2m was used to calculate the grade.

Grade cutting was not used in the calculation of the resource and no discussion was given as to why
it was not employed. It is recommended that a study be undertaken to determine if an appropriate
top cut need be applied
No data is available on the process of validation.
No data is available.
The Mineral Resource Estimate is above a cut-off grade of 3.89 g/t Au. This is based on the assumed
mining cost at the time of the estimate.
The Mineral Resource Estimate considered the assumptions outlined below which are considered
appropriate;
Metal prices: Au US$550 Oz Ag US$10 Oz
Metallurgical Recovery; Au – 80% Ag – 70% Zn - nil
Operating cost: US$55t based on underground cut and fill mining and flotation and
cyanidation combined
The minimum mining width of 0.8m was assumed for veins less than 0.6m and for wider widths a
dilution of 0.2m was used to calculate the grade.
Historical metallurgical test-work is currently under review however the assumptions used (80% Au
recovery 70% Ag and no zinc recovery) seem conservative. The most recent test work was conducted
in 2000 and was a preliminary assessment only. This work was conducted at Lakefield Labs
(cyanidation) and CIMM Labs (flotation) in Chile. While this work is preliminary it indicates recoveries
for differential flotation in conjunction with a Knelson concentrator at 80% each for gold and silver
and 50% for zinc regardless of the type of material (sulphide or oxidized).

It is considered that there are no significant environmental factors which would prevent the eventual
extraction of gold from the project. Environmental surveys and assessments will form a part of future
pre-feasibility.

CEL is collecting specific gravity measurements from drill core recovered in 2019 and 2020 drilling
programs, which it is expected will be able to be used to estimate the block and bulk densities in
future resource estimates.
The Mineral Resource Estimate has both Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource classifications
under the National Instrument 43-101 code and is considered foreign. These classifications are
considered appropriate given the confidence that can be gained from the existing data and results
from drilling.
The reliability of input data for the 2003 and 2006 resources is acceptable as is the confidence in
continuity of geology and metal values quality quantity and distribution of the data. Appropriate
account has been taken of all relevant factors with the exception of studies into the appropriateness
of the application of a top cut.

Commentary

Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy and confidence
level in the Mineral Resource estimate using an approach or procedure
deemed appropriate by the Competent Person. For example the
application of statistical or geostatistical procedures to quantify the
relative accuracy of the resource within stated confidence limits or if
such an approach is not deemed appropriate a qualitative discussion of
the factors that could affect the relative accuracy and confidence of the
estimate.
The statement should specify whether it relates to global or local
estimates and if local state the relevant tonnages which should be
relevant to technical and economic evaluation. Documentation should
include assumptions made and the procedures used.
These statements of relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate
should be compared with production data where available.

report were released to the TSX. This report concluded that “Detailed resource calculations made by
three different groups are seen to be realistic.
There is sufficient confidence in the data quality drilling methods and analytical results that they can
be relied upon. The available geology and assay data correlate well. The approach or procedure are
deemed appropriate given the confidence limits. The main two factors which could affect relative
accuracy is grade continuity and top cut.
Grade continuity is variable in nature in this style of deposit and has not been demonstrated to date
and closer spaced drilling is required to improve the understanding of the grade continuity in both
strike and dip directions. It is noted that the results from the twinning of three holes by La Mancha
are encouraging in terms of grade repeatability.
The deposit contains very high grades and there is a potential need for the use of a top cut. It is
noted that an arbitrary grade reduction factor of 10% has already been applied to the resource as
reported.
No production data is available for comparison
