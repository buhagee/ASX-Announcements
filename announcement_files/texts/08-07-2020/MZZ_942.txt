Matador successfully completes $8.7 million
placement

Highlights
• The Company has successfully completed an $8.7 million Placement (“Placement”), issuing 21.4 million
shares at a price of $0.405 per share – a 44.5 % premium to the 15-day VWAP.

• The Company received strong demand for the Placement from Australian and international institutional
investors.

• Proceeds from the Placement will be used to fund exploration activities at the Company’s 100% owned
Cape Ray Gold Project in Newfoundland, Canada, where a 12,000m drill campaign and a major
greenfield exploration program will commence shortly.

• Funded for the next two exploration seasons (2020 and 2021).
• Site preparation are underway, with drilling to start in the coming weeks.
• Shares issued at a premium price as “flow through shares” under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (“Act”),
facilitated by Canadian leading flow-through share dealer, Peartree Securities Inc.

Matador Mining Limited (ASX: MZZ, MZZO) (“Matador” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it
has raised proceeds of $8.7 million (before costs) from the placement of 21.43 million shares at a price of
$0.405 per share which represents:


A 28.5% premium to the last closing price of Matador shares on 1 July 2020 of $0.315 per share; and



A 44.5 % premium to the 15-day volume weighted average price of Matador shares to 1 July 2020
of $0.28 per share.

The Company was able to issue the Placement shares at a premium, as they were issued as Canadian
charity flow-through shares, which provides tax incentives to those investors for expenditures that qualify as
flow through mining expenditures under the Act.
The Company will commence a 12,000m drill program together with a major greenfields exploration
program later this month. A detailed overview of this year’s exploration program and strategy will be
released shortly. Together with existing cash, anticipated proceeds from the exercise of listed options and
completion of the Placement, based on current forecast work programs and budget estimates, the
Company expects to be funded to complete the 2020 and 2021 exploration programs.
The term “flow-through share” is a defined term in the Act and is not a special type of share under corporate
law. In this case, the term “flow-through share” refers to an ordinary share that will be issued by the Company
to an investor under a written agreement with the investor whereby the Company agrees to incur flow
through mining expenditure, and to renounce tax losses associated with that expenditure to the investor. If
the Company and the investor comply with the rules in the Act, the investor will be entitled to deduct the
amount renounced in computing the investor’s income for Canadian income tax purposes and as a result,
the flow-through shares are issued at a higher price.
