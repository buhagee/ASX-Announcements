ABOUT US
Candy Club is a US-based confectionery company that is focused
on its fast-growing B2B wholesale business, which has grown out
of a long-running B2C subscription business. Candy Club operates
through two main distribution channels – traditional brick-andmortar stores and e-commerce.

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

For personal use only

COMPANY BACKGROUND
Founded in 2015, Candy Club started as a pureplay business-to-consumer (B2C) subscription-only business.
Candy Club re-calibrated its strategy in September 2019, pivoting its business to retailers where a gap in the
market for high-end candy products was identified.
Since then, the B2B market has become the Company’s primary driver, consistently hitting significant milestones
every quarter across all its key metrics.

Candy Club’s key strategy is to acquire prominent national retail accounts, owning the under-utilised retail space at
point-of-sale.

HIGHLIGHTS
Candy Club recorded a remarkable 2Q FY2020 while operating in an extremely challenging environment:
The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread closures of brick-and-mortar stores for most of the 2Q,
There have been further delays in store openings due to civil unrest in the US,
There has been stock unavailability on high-demand items due to an unexpected sales surge, and,
Lastly, 2Q is usually a seasonally softer quarter.
The strong quarter was mainly driven by the spectacular growth in B2B segment that grew 135% QoQ. YoY, growth
in B2B gross revenue was 503%.

The growth is mainly on the back of sales surge from retailers (providing essential services which are unaffected by
the pandemic closures), online pureplay e-commerce boutiques and traditional brick-and-mortar e-commerce
websites.

Note: 1) YoY: year-on-year.

HIGHLIGHTS
Candy Club expects to be profitable (EBITDA-positive) in 4Q FY2020 with its current balance sheet and available
financing facilities .
Candy Club enters the second half of FY2020 with a very promising outlook. Furthermore, 3Q and 4Q are usually
seasonally stronger quarters, which will benefit Candy Club.

As the situation with COVID-19, civil unrest and stock unavailability normalises in the US, Candy Club expects the
traditional brick-and-mortar B2B retailers to return and B2B revenue growth to accelerate further.

The difference between the EBITDA loss and NOCF
can be attributed to inventory purchases required to
support future growth (US$365k), financing costs
related to securing financing lines (US$100k) and
interest (US$35k).
NOCF will remain negative in the short term to
support necessary inventory purchases resulting
from further anticipated growth.
There is availability under the inventory credit
facility that will be used to support near-term cash
requirements.

WHITE SPACE STRATEGY
There are several reasons why this opportunity exists, including:
Category leaders are more mass market-focused and their products are not a good fit for specialty market
retailers due to pricing, package and lack of product differentiation
Fragmented specialty market manufacturers that are limited to selling their own product range
Lack of innovation and investment

Candy Club is uniquely qualified to dominate this landscape of over 3.2 million retail doors.
B2C subscription model seeded the marketplace with consumer advertising and brand recognition.
B2C model created scalable supply chain with access to diverse product line to all manufacturers and candy
types.
Public entity with access to resources.
Scalable infrastructure.
Skilled management team and board with track record of building businesses at scale.
