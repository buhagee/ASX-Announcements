PENGANA PRIVATE EQUITY TRUST
COMPLETION OF RIGHTS ISSUE

Pengana Investment Management Limited (‘PIML’, ‘Responsible Entity’) is pleased to announce the
completion of the Pengana Private Equity Trust (‘the Trust’, ASX: PE1) pro-rata non-renounceable rights
issue (‘Rights Issue’) of units in the Trust (‘Units’) with part of the shortfall allocated to sophisticated investors
(‘Sophisticated Investor Shortfall Placement’).
Eligible Unitholders had the opportunity to subscribe for 1 new unit (‘New Unit’) for every 3 units held at the
record date (‘Entitlement’), at an issue price of $1.25 per New Unit. Eligible Unitholders who took up their full
Entitlement also had the opportunity to apply for additional New Units under a shortfall facility (‘Shortfall
Facility’).
Pursuant to Exception 3 of Listing Rule 7.2, PIML can issue New Units to make up the shortfall on a pro-rata
issue of Units to existing unitholders in the Trust. In addition to making available a shortfall facility to Eligible
Unitholders who took up their full Entitlement, PIML has also determined to make up part of the shortfall on
the Rights Issue through an issue of New Units to sophisticated investors. These sophisticated investors fall
under the definition of ‘wholesale clients’ pursuant to the Corporations Act and, accordingly, a PDS is not
required to be prepared for the issue of New Units to them.
In total, PE1 will raise $48,038,530 through the issue of 38,430,824 new units pursuant to the Rights Issue
and Sophisticated Investor Shortfall Placement. The results are as follows:

The Directors of PIML reserve the right to place any or all of the remaining 16,367,507 Shortfall units within
three months of the closing of the Rights Issue pursuant to Exception 3 of Listing Rule 7.2. Details of excess
demand from Sophisticated Investors, resulting in over subscription, is expected to be announced to
the market by Wednesday 15 July 2020.
