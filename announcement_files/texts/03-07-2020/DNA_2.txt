Donaco launches $14.4m capital raising
Donaco International Limited (ASX: DNA) (“Donaco” or “Company”) is pleased to announce
an equity raising to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet to provide immediate capital.
The capital raising is being undertaken by way of a fully underwritten pro rata nonrenounceable entitlement offer on the basis of 1 new share for every 2 existing shares held
by eligible holders at an issue price of $0.035 per new share, to raise approximately $14.41
million (Entitlement Offer).
The Entitlement Offer is fully underwritten by Mr Lee Bug Huy and Lee Bug Tong who
currently have a relevant interest of 17.99% in the Company (Underwriters).
The Directors of the Company have determined that the Company is in urgent need of
capital as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's gaming operations and the
requirement to make repayments under the Company's debt facilities with Mega Bank. As
part of the capital raising process, Donaco has approached a number of parties and
assessed various options available for underwriting or other funding options.
However, due to the COVID-19 financial environment and the current status of the
Company’s borrowing with covenant waivers being required, the Company was not able to
identify any appropriate alternative sources of capital. In the circumstances, the Company
has decided to proceed with the Entitlement Offer providing eligible shareholders with an
opportunity to invest in the Company and whilst ensuring funding certainty by having the
Entitlement Offer fully underwritten by the Underwriters.
Non-Executive Chairman Mel Ashton said the funding aligned with Donaco’s key objectives
of limiting debt, preserving shareholder value and providing immediate financial stability
for the Company.
“COVID-19 travel restrictions, the consequent closing of international borders, and the
closure of casinos in Vietnam and Cambodia (with the casino in Vietnam now partially
operational), has significantly impacted the financial position of the Company. This capital

injection will enable us to stabilise our immediate financial needs, and meet the upcoming
repayment requirements on our borrowings,” Mr Ashton said.
“The implementation of our proactive cost reduction strategy and the additional equity
from the capital raising will help stabilise the Company’s balance sheet at a critical time.”
Subject to completion of the Entitlement Offer and associated underwrite, the Company
will appoint Mr Lee Bug Huy and Mr Paul Porntat Amatavivadhana as Non-Executive
Directors of the Company.
It is the intention of current Non-Executive Directors Mr Mel Ashton and Mr Simon Vertullo
will retire from the Board at the completion of the Entitlement Offer or shortly thereafter.
The Company is engaging in a recruitment process for additional directors (including
Australian residents) to join the Board at completion of the Entitlement Offer.
Full details of the capital raising are set out in a Prospectus lodged today with the ASX and
