▪

Follow up surface sampling programs are underway at Ternera and Toro Gordo.
Assay results expected from surface sampling in 2 to 3 weeks, drilling results to follow.
Data collection activities have commenced for scoping study inputs including metallurgical,
geotechnical, hydrological and environmental studies.

Tesoro Resources Limited (ASX: TSO) (Tesoro or the Company) is pleased to announce that drilling
has commenced at the Ternera Prospect, El Zorro Gold Project (El Zorro), Chile. Two diamond drill
rigs have commenced infill and extensional drilling at Ternera, with the program aiming to further
delineate the Ternera deposit. An initial 20 holes are planned for approximately 5,000m of drilling.
Tesoro Managing Director Zeff Reeves commented:
“Our team is pleased to be back on the ground at El Zorro drilling and working to delineate further
gold mineralisation at El Zorro. We have commenced this program with an initial two diamond drill
rigs, drilling infill and extensional holes at Ternera. To date Ternera has produced some encouraging
results and we are moving quickly to expand on these to further delineate the deposit. In addition,
we are working on several other activities in parallel to our exploration activities to advance the
project forward as quickly as possible. We are excited at what lies ahead for El Zorro and Tesoro.”
The Company has engaged a geophysical services contractor to conduct an IP survey over the
Ternera area (Figure 3) to assess the suitability of the method at identifying mineralised fault zones
within the El Zorro Tonalite (EZT – host rock). If successful it is envisaged the IP survey would be

About Tesoro

For personal use only

Tesoro Resources Limited was established with a strategy of acquiring,
exploring and developing mining projects in the Coastal Cordillera region of
Chile. The Coastal Cordillera region is host to multiple world class copper and
gold mines, has well established infrastructure, service providers and an
experienced mining workforce. Large areas of the Coastal Cordillera remain
unexplored due to the unconsolidated nature of mining concession
ownership, but Tesoro, via its in-country network and experience has been
able secure rights to a district scale gold project in-line with the Company’s
strategy. Tesoro has rights to acquire up to 80% of the El Zorro Gold Project.
