Potential High Grade Manganese Concentrate Zone Identified at Butcherbird
Element 25 Limited (E25 or Company) (ASX:E25) is pleased to announce that sub-sampling of
diamond core from BBDD016 drilled into the Coodamudgi manganese resource at the
Company’s 100% owned Butcherbird Manganese Project (Project) has returned high grade
manganese values of up to 42.3%Mn from surface with low impurity levels.
Importantly the Coodamudgi resource is located entirely within granted
mining lease M52/1074.
The manganese mineralisation at Butcherbird typically comprises interlayered
bands of manganese and non-manganese bearing clays and shales. The
manganese mineralisation in BBDD016 is geologically the same. The manganese
can be beneficiated by separating and removing the clay and shale waste and
retaining the high-grade manganese material.
The sub-sampling methodology utilised is designed to emulate full scale processing
via the proposed beneficiation flowsheet for the Project. It should be noted that the
work completed in this programme is preliminary and will need to be followed up with further test work to
confirm these results, however the sampling reported herein is strongly suggestive that this material has
the potential to deliver a high-grade concentrate.
E25 Managing Director Mr Justin Brown commented, “The grades achieved in the subsampling exercise at
Coodamudgi are indicative of the potential to achieve a product grade in excess of the grades published in
the PFS of 33%Mn. If this can be confirmed under full scale test work, this has the potential to be a very
positive step forward.”

Table 1: Subsampling results for manganese bands in diamond drillhole BBDD016.

Drillhole BBDD016 was completed as part of a metallurgical programme completed in 20131, however only
a single 2cm section of the core was sampled, which returned a manganese grade of 42.2%. At the time,
the Company’s focus turned elsewhere and metallurgical testing of this hole was not undertaken. This
programme is a more comprehensive sampling exercise to follow up the previous work and the results
confirm the potential of this area to produce a high-grade manganese concentrate through beneficiation.

About the Butcherbird Manganese Project
The Butcherbird Manganese Project is a world class manganese resource with current JORC resources in
excess of 263 Mt of manganese ore2. The Company has recently completed a Pre-Feasibility Study with
respect to developing the deposit to produce manganese concentrate for export to generate early
cashflow with a modest capital requirement3. The outstanding economics and low capital hurdle of less
than A$15 million will allow the Company to develop the project in a relatively short timeframe.
This is envisaged as the first stage of a staged ramp up for the project and has the advantage of potentially
providing early cashflow to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and assist in funding of the larger
high purity manganese production hub which is the subject of a parallel, complimentary work stream.
The Project straddles the Great Northern Highway and the Goldfields Gas Pipeline providing turnkey
logistics and energy solutions. The Company is also intending to integrate renewable energy into the
power solution to minimise the carbon intensity of the Project as well as reducing energy costs. A cleaner,
lower carbon flowsheet and high penetration renewable energy will place Butcherbird at the forefront of
sustainable metal production.

Commentary

•

• Samples were selected for analysis based on visual logs of manganese content. The geology of
the manganese mineralisation at Butcherbird comprises interlayered bands of manganese and
non manganese clay and shale.
• Manganese enriched layers are easily identified visually allowing the manganese to be selectively
sampled which emulates the outcome of processing the material through a beneficiation plant
and therefore provides an indicative concentrate grade that can be achived.
• The manganese bands were visually subsampled for assay with the results reported herein.

JORC Code explanation

Commentary

•

If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature
should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear
statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).

•

The mineralisation is flat lying, the drilling is vertical and the intersections are true width.

Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be
included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative
reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid
misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not
limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results;
bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth
extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
