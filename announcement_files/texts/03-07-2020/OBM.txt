The Offer
The $55 million equity raising will comprise:

For personal use only

•
•

a two-tranche institutional placement of up to approximately 174 million new shares to raise
up to approximately $40 million (“Placement”); and
the issue of approximately 66 million new shares under an underwritten 1 for 9 accelerated
non-renounceable entitlement offer to raise up to approximately $15 million (“Entitlement
Offer”). The Entitlement Offer will consist of an Institutional Entitlement Offer and a Retail
Entitlement Offer,

(the Placement and the Entitlement Offer together being the “Offer”).
All new shares offered under the Offer will be issued at a price of $0.23 per new share, which
represents a:
•
•

9.80% discount to the last traded price of $0.2550 on 2 July 2020; and
7.18% discount to the TERP of $0.2478.1

Each new share issued under the Offer will rank equally with existing fully paid ordinary shares in the
Company on issue. The Company will, upon issue of the new shares under the Offer, seek quotation
of the new shares on the ASX.
Upon completion of the Offer, the Company will have approximately 829,785,227 shares on issue. As
the Entitlement Offer is non-renounceable, entitlements cannot be traded and are not otherwise
transferable.
Hartleys Limited has been appointed as Lead Manager for the Offer and Underwriter of the
Entitlement Offer. The underwriter may terminate its underwriting obligations upon the occurrence
of certain termination events, which are customary in nature. Further details of these termination
events are set out in Annexure 1.
Placement
The Placement will comprise the issue of approximately 173,913,044 new fully paid ordinary Ora
Banda shares to certain sophisticated and professional investors to raise approximately $40 million
at an issue price of $0.23 per share.
The Placement will comprise two tranches, being:
•

•

Tranche 1: the issue of approximately 95,667,216 new shares to sophisticated and
professional investors pursuant to the Company’s existing placement capacity under ASX
Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.1A; and
Tranche 2: subject to shareholder approval, the issue of a minimum of 78,245,828 new shares
to the Company’s major shareholder, Hawke’s Point.

1

The Theoretical Ex-Rights Price (TERP) is the theoretical price at which Ora Banda shares should trade immediately after the ex-date
for the Entitlement Offer. TERP is a theoretical calculation only and the actual price at which shares trade immediately after the exdate for the Entitlement Offer will depend on many factors and may not equate to TERP. The TERP calculation includes shares issued
under the Placement.

It is anticipated that Tranche 1 of the Placement will be allotted in the following portions (further
details of the proposed share issue are detailed in the Appendix 3B lodged by the Company today):
•
•

Listing Rule 7.1: 88,542,744 new shares; and
Listing Rule 7.1A: 7,124,472 new shares.

The Company confirms that the issue price of $0.23 satisfies the requirements of Listing Rule 7.1A.
A general meeting to consider whether to approve the issue of the new shares pursuant to Tranche
2 of the Placement expected to be held in late August 2020.
Subject to shareholder approval, Hawke’s Point has committed to subscribe for at least 78,245,828
new shares under Tranche 2 of the Placement.
The Placement is not underwritten.
Institutional Entitlement Offer
Eligible institutional shareholders with registered addresses in the offering jurisdictions will be invited
to participate in the accelerated institutional component of the Entitlement Offer, which will be

all, part or none of their entitlement.
The Institutional Entitlement Offer is fully underwritten.

Offer.

Further details about the Retail Entitlement Offer will be detailed in the Offer Document that will be

contemplated in this agreement, including the offer size, structure and pricing, and the
Underwriter will have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto; and

(h)

further, neither the Underwriter and the Company acknowledge and agree that nothing in
or related to the Underwriting Agreement, the prior relationship between the parties, any
services provided or representations made by the Underwriter to the company in

Agreement or any other matter represents or implies any fiduciary relationship or any other
category of commercial relationship recognised at law or in equity as giving rise to forms of
specific rights and obligations, except the contractual rights expressly set out in the
