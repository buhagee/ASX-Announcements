Finsure Aggregation Update
Finsure continues to achieve strong settlement volumes, settling $2.83b in April and
May 2020, 32% higher against April and May 2019. Finsure broker numbers also
increased to 1,716 at the end of May, an increase of 74 brokers YoY. Finsure’s market
share continues to grow recording an all-time record of $1.48b settlement volumes in
May 2020. According to electronic lodgement portal NextGen, Finsure was ranked 4th
highest in lodgement volumes across all aggregators in May 2020.
This brings the total Aggregation loan book to $44.7b with the aggregation business on
track to have a record 4th quarter. Finsure’s proprietary software platform also
continues to improve with integrations to Allianz and CoreLogic over the period.
“Despite COVID, Finsure’s growth continues to be a standout with record settlement
volumes and also strong broker recruitment during April and May 2020. Based on ABS
data and internal estimates Finsure’s market share of home lending commitments is
now in excess of 5%. This growing scale is now driving sustainable profit growth in its
own right and creating increased margin opportunities within the banking and
wholesale units” said Finsure Managing Director John Kolenda

Banking & Wholesale Update
As previously advised BNK took steps to deliberately moderate loan originations
through Q4FY20 as a prudent response to the uncertainty around the COVID-19
disruption. BNK has slowly reactivated loan originations from June onwards. During
the period 1 March to 31 May 2020 5.6% (by value) of BNK’s customers were provided
with COVID related relief packages consisting of short term (3-6 month) payment
deferrals. The volume of requests is currently very low with only 2 requests received
in June 2020.
BNK has navigated COVID well with BNK on balance sheet loans remaining stable at
$288m. BNK’s substantially improved deposit base grew to $363m with a reduction in
higher cost term deposits being replaced by new to bank transaction account funding
now $109m as of 31 May 2020, doubling YoY. This ratio has improved throughout June
to approx. 35% and remains a key aim for the Bank to lower its cost of funds and
diversify its funding sources.

BNK’s Boss Access Account was acknowledged as the best Small Business Exceptional
Everyday Account and the Retire-Style Account took top prize in the Pensioner
Account category at the 2020 Mozo Experts Choice Awards for Bank Accounts &
Savings Accounts.
Wholesale (Better Choice) also settled $70m of loans over April and May and ended
the period with a $2.3b loan book, flat for the period. Better Choice products were
launched to PLAN Australia brokers on 4th June. PLAN Australia has an aggregation
business of 1,600 brokers which represents a significant increase in Better Choice’s
distribution capabilities.
BNK has made substantial progress to diversify off balance sheet funding and
establish a securitisation program. BNK has received indicative terms from two
financial institutions and is progressing discussions and due diligence with the target
of having a program set up in late 2020.
