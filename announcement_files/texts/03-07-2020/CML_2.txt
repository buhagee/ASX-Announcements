LORRAINE MINE GOLD DRILLING PROGRAMME UPDATE
•

Diamond drillhole CM-20-01 targeting gold mineralisation between 310 and 340m downhole was
at 248m last night.

Chase Mining Corporation Limited (“CML” or “The Company”) provides the following update on the
progress of the Lorraine Mine Gold Project diamond drill programme targeting the gold (plus copper
and silver) mineralisation reported from historic sampling and limited drilling associated with the 6-Level
development of the Lorraine Nickel Mine in Southwestern Quebec (ASX Announcements 9 June and
1 July 2020).
Diamond drillhole CM-20-01 targeting gold mineralisation between 310 and 340m downhole was at
248m at end of shift last night (Figures 1 and 2). Pending no breakdowns, the hole will be completed,
surveyed and the core visually logged and reported to the ASX on Monday 6 July.

In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be
relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1
m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30g charge
for fire assay’). In other cases, more explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g.
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air

The Company is focused on the exploration for Ni-Cu-Co-PGM
mineralised gabbro bodies which intrude a sequence of mafic
volcanic and felsic volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks in the BelleterreAngliers Greenstone Belt. The BAGB contains a number of gold
deposits
Gold mineralisation at the Lorraine Mine occurs as shear zone
hosted quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite veins footwall to Lorraine Ni-CuPGE massive sulphide body
The Company’s website and listed ASX Announcements contain
numerous references to the ‘Bonanza Grade Gold Mineralisation’ at
the Lorraine Mine and of the Company’s intension to drill the gold
mineralised zone

If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from
the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly
explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade
results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used
for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of
such aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there
should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true
width not known’).
