About OncoSil
OncoSil Medical is a medical device company seeking to advance radiation for cancer patients. OncoSil Medical’s lead product,
OncoSil™ is a targeted radioactive isotope (Phosphorus-32), implanted directly into a patient’s pancreatic tumours via an
endoscopic ultrasound.
Treatment with the OncoSil™ is intended to deliver more concentrated and localised beta radiation compared to external beam
radiation. OncoSil Medical has conducted six clinical studies with positive results on tolerability, safety and efficacy. CE Marking
has been granted for the OncoSil™ device which can be marketed in the European Union and the United Kingdom.
An Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) has been granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct
a clinical study of the OncoSil™ device aimed at supporting a PMA approval.
In December 2018, the FDA granted Humanitarian Use Designation (HUD) for the OncoSil™ device for the treatment of
unresectable intrahepatic and distal cholangiocarcinoma. In March 2020, the FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation for
the OncoSil™ for unresectable pancreatic cancer in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy.
Pancreatic cancer is typically diagnosed at a later stage, when there is a poor prognosis for long-term survival. The World Cancer
Research Fund estimated that in 2012, 338,000 people globally were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The prognosis for patients
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, regardless of stage, is generally poor; the relative five-year survival rate for all stages combined
is approximately 5%. The estimated world-wide market opportunity for OncoSil™ in pancreatic cancer exceeds $3b.

Background
• Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy with a very poor prognosis and remains an area
of high unmet medical need.

For personal use only

• Current standard treatment for patients with unresectable locally advanced
pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is limited to chemotherapy (CT-only) or
chemoradiotherapy following induction CT (ICT + CCRT).
• International guidelines (e.g. ESMO, ASCO and NCCN) recommend gemcitabinebased regimens or monotherapy as well as regimens containing fluoropyrimidines
(capecitabine, 5FU) plus other agents, or ICT + CCRT, for the treatment of
unresectable LAPC.1–3
• Brachytherapy using beta-emitting phosphorus (P-32) microparticles enables a
predetermined radiation dose to be implanted into pancreatic tumours via
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance.
• The results of a prospective, international, multi-centre, interventional, open-label,
single-arm pilot study of P-32 microparticles (OncoSilTM; OncoSil Medical) in
combination with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy
demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy in patients with unresectable LAPC
(the PanCO study: NCT03003078).4

Objective

• In the absence of a head-to-head randomised controlled trial, a naïve indirect
treatment comparison (a universally accepted method to provide a valid
categorical and statistical comparison of reported outcomes) was used to assess
the results of the PanCO study against ‘state-of-the-art’ (SOTA) therapy obtained
from a systematic literature review (SLR) of published scientific literature from
prospective Phase II and III clinical studies.
• This enabled a robust determination as to whether the improvements observed in
the PanCO study were due to CT alone or the combination of CT with OncoSilTM.

Methods

• A SLR was conducted, based on a previous systematic review and meta-analysis
by Chang et al (2018),5 to identify published clinical data on SOTA/’standard-ofcare’ treatments from prospective Phase II and III clinical studies in patients with
unresectable LAPC treated with CT-only or ICT + CCRT (excluding borderline
resectable LAPC; for inclusion criteria, see Table 1).
• A weighted median of medians method and meta-analysis of proportional
outcomes were used to provide summary statistics for SLR outcomes.6
• Meta-analysis was performed in the statistical software R and R studio using the
R Functions meta,7 metaprop8 and metamedian.9
• The SLR outcomes were then compared with the results of the PanCO study in a
naïve indirect treatment comparison.
• A binomial test was applied to assess the strength of the PanCO results relative to
the SOTA CT-only and ICT + CCRT (comparator) studies of the meta-analysis for
overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), one-year survival, resection
rate, disease control rate (DCR) and overall response rate (ORR).

• The PanCO study enrolled 50 patients (Intention-to-Treat [ITT] population) of
which 42 were implanted with P-32 microparticles (Per Protocol [PP] population),
with a median follow-up of 16.1 months.4

Overall Survival

Table 8: PanCO PFS Outcomes vs. ‘SOTA’ Regimens

• Median OS was significantly longer (p<0.001) in the PanCO study ITT and PP
cohorts than CT-only and ICT + CCRT regimens (Tables 3 and 4), representing a
~20% reduction in the risk of death compared to CT-only and ICT + CCRT studies
(Hazard Ratio PP: 0.79; ITT: 0.82). The PanCO median OS for ITT and PP cohorts
were also significantly longer than the CT-only (p<0.001) and ICT + CCRT subgroups (p=0.0001 or <0.0001).

Conclusions
• The results from the PanCO study provide a broad and consistently positive
outcomes compared to standard-of-care CT-only and ICT + CCRT regimens.
• The naïve indirect treatment comparison to state-of-the-art therapy
indicated that P-32 microparticles combined with standard-of-care
chemotherapy may provide significant and clinically relevant benefits for
patients with unresectable LAPC and a valuable treatment option in an area
of high unmet medical need.

Table 3: Most Commonly Reported AEs (≥20% Incidence in PP Cohort)

Methods

• International, multicentre, single-arm pilot study (Fig. 1); with 10 sites in
3 countries: Australia, Belgium and the UK. Recruitment period: March 2017
to June 2018.
• Chemotherapy: gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX, by physician
choice, per SoC.
• 32P Microparticles was implanted directly into the pancreatic tumour via EUS
guidance, using fine needle aspiration; 32P activity was calculated from the tumour
volume to administer a predicted absorbed dose of 100 Gy; 32P diffusion pattern
following implantation was assessed by EUS and Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT
within 4 hours and at 7 days post-implantation.
• Safety data was collected weekly with toxicity graded using CTCAE v4.0.
• Independent central reader analysis of 8-weekly CT scans for response
assessment by RECIST 1.1 and tumour volume (using Voxels of Interest and
eMass software [ERT; Brussels]) and FDG-PET scans (Baseline vs. Week 12).
Key Eligibility Criteria
• Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas;
Unresectable locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma; Target tumour diameter
2–6cm; ECOG Performance Status 0 to 1; No distant metastases; No prior
radiotherapy or chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
Primary Endpoint: Safety and Tolerability
Primary Performance Outcome: Local Disease Control Rate at 16 weeks (LDCR16 weeks)
Statistical Assumptions for LDCR16 weeks Efficacy Assessment
• Null hypothesis H0: p = 0.55; Alternative hypothesis H1: p = 0.75. Level of
significance = 0.05 with a 2-sided test to achieve a power of 80%.

Frequency of AE/SAE events

For personal use only

• Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) accounts for 30% to 40% of all
pancreatic cancer presentations.1 Unresectable LAPC has a poor prognosis with
a median survival of <12 months.2 Current Standard-of-Care (SoC) remains limited
to chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy.
• Phosphorous-32 (32P) Microparticles (OncoSilTM; OncoSil Medical) is a
brachytherapy device that implants a predetermined 100 Gy dose of betaradiation-emitting 32P into pancreatic tumours via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
guidance.
– 32P Microparticles investigated in combination with gemcitabine monotherapy in
23 patients with LAPC and metastatic disease in 2 studies, demonstrating
acceptable tolerability and safety.
– CE Marking approval for EU and US FDA ‘Breakthrough’ Designation have
recently been granted for OncoSil™.
• This analysis reports updated results of the ‘PanCO’ pilot study of
32
P Microparticles in combination with SoC chemotherapy in patients
with unresectable LAPC

(see Table 10), 9 received gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel; 1 received FOLFIRINOX.
Resections took place from 70 to 267 days post-implantation.
• At least 4 further patients were sufficiently downstaged to be technically
considered for surgical resection but could not undergo surgery due to
concomitant co-morbidities and/or other considerations (advanced age,
patient choice).
• HPB surgeons noted reduction in the fibrosis of the tumours along blood vessels
and favourable tissue planes.

Conclusions
• Use of EUS-guided 32P implantation is feasible, with an acceptable safety
profile in combination with first-line SoC chemotherapy for LAPC over a
prolonged study timeframe
– Relatively few AEs were attributed to the OncoSil™ device and/or
implantation procedure compared to chemotherapy
• At a relatively mature follow-up (median 16.1 months), the PanCO study
results provide a consistent set of outcomes that suggest clinically
relevant benefits for patients with unresectable LAPC treated using the
OncoSil™ device in combination with systemic chemotherapy
• Encouraging clinical efficacy outcomes were observed, particularly
tumour response (LDCR, ORR, Tumour Volume, CA19-9 and FDG-PET),
surgical resection with curative intent (including a high proportion with
R0 margins), PFS and overall survival
• Further clinical studies on OncoSil™ are in development

CA 19-9 Response (PP Cohort; in Participants with Baseline ≥35 U/mL Prior to
Resection)
• ≥50% reduction in CA 19-9 was reported in 81.3% of patients; ≥70% reduction
in 65.6%; and ≥90% reduction in 37.5% (see Table 8/Figure 4).
FDG-PET Response (PP Cohort; Baseline vs. Week 12 Prior to Resection)
• Metabolic resolution (100% reduction in TLG and SUV Max) and absence of
defined viable neoplastic disease for 5 study participants at Week 12
(see Table 9/Figure 5).
