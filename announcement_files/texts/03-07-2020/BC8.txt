High-Grade Diamond Drilling Intersections at Myhree

10m @ 7.55 g/t Au from 20m

ASX Announcement
3 July 2020

For personal use only

Black Cat Syndicate Limited (“Black Cat” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce an update on
activities at the Bulong Gold Project (“Bulong”), including results from recent diamond drilling at
Myhree.
HIGHLIGHTS
−

Recent diamond drilling at Myhree intersected numerous zones of high-grade mineralisation.
Holes were drilled into the lower parts of the Myhree system to infill mineralisation at depth for
conversion of Inferred Resource to Indicated, while also providing additional core samples for
geotechnical and metallurgical test work.

−

Results to date include:
o

6.45m @ 9.43 g/t Au from 228.51m (20MYDD002);

o

1.97m @ 11.68 g/t Au from 155.06m (20MYDD007);

o

2.47m @ 13.62 g/t Au from 84.38m (20MYDD008); and

o

2.14m @ 21.03 g/t Au from 95.06m (20MYDD008).

Black Cat’s Managing Director, Gareth Solly said:

“Myhree continues to deliver strong results, with high-grade intersections consistent with previous
drilling as per our expectations. The geotechnical results and positive gold assays will be fed into
the Myhree mining study. The recent RC drilling at Bulong has also now been completed and assays
are expected in mid-July 2020. Additional diamond holes are currently being drilled at Myhree with
results due in late August 2020. RC drill planning on priority targets at Fingals is now underway and
will be announced in July 2020.”

For personal use only

Diamond drilling consisted of 6 holes (1,421m including 802m of RC pre-collars). These holes were
designed to infill mineralisation at depth for conversion of Inferred Resource to Indicated, while also
providing additional core samples for geotechnical and metallurgical test work. Holes were
positioned to provide representative samples and rock conditions for potential mining scenarios.
Lithologies encountered included sediments and highly altered mafic rocks, interleaved with
ultramafic rocks. High gold grades continue to show a correlation between quartz veining, sulphide
content and increased deformation, particularly near the volcanic/sediment contacts (Figure 2).
Assay results include:

BULONG 2012 JORC TABLE 1
Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria

JORC Code Explanation

Commentary

Sampling techniques

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report. In cases where ‘industry
standard’ work has been done this would be relatively
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m
samples from which 3kg was pulverised to produce a 30g
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may
be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has
inherent sampling problems.

Black Cat has recently undertaken sampling activities at Myhree via diamond (“DD”) drilling.

Drilling techniques

Drill sample recovery

Logging

P a g e | 11

Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample
recoveries and results assessed.
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and
grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.
Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support
appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies
and metallurgical studies.

DD drilling undertaken by Black Cat provides high quality representative samples that are carried out to industry
standard and include QAQC standards. All samples are weighed in the laboratory.
Core samples were cut into halves and sample sizes range from 0.2m to 1.2m.
All samples are crushed, dried and pulverised to a nominal 90% passing 75µm to produce a 40g or 50g sub sample
for analysis by FA/AAS.

Diamond drilling was HQ core size.

DD drilling recoveries are checked by logging RQD data on a meter by meter basis.
RC sample recovery and representivity were maintained through industry standard maintenance of the cone splitter
and verified through the use of duplicate samples. DD samples were half cored and the same half was consistently
submitted for assay.
There is no known bias between sample recovery and grade.

Logging of diamond core record lithology, mineralogy, texture, mineralisation, weathering, colour, alteration, veining
and structure.
All core is photographed and stored for later use.

P a g e | 12

All recent drilling has been logged in full.
Core was cut to half core.
Not applicable.
The laboratory preparation of samples adheres to industry best practice. It is conducted by a commercial laboratory
and involves oven drying, coarse crushing then total grinding to a size of 90% passing 75µm.
All subsampling activities are carried out by commercial laboratory and are considered to be satisfactory.
Black Cat’s DD field duplicate samples are carried out at a rate of 1:50 and Selected in areas of geological interest.
These are submitted for the same assay process as the original samples.
Sample sizes of 3kg are considered to be appropriate given the grain size (90% passing 75µm) of the material
sampled.
Samples are analysed by an external laboratory using a 40g fire assay with AAS finish. This method is considered
suitable for determining gold concentrations in rock and is a total digest method.
None used.

Recent drilling adhered to strict QAQC protocols involving weighing of samples, collection of field duplicates and
insertion of certified reference material (blanks and standards). QAQC data are checked against reference limits in
the SQL database on import.
The laboratory performs a number of internal processes including repeats, standards and blanks. Analysis of this
data displayed acceptable precision and accuracy.
Black Cat’s significant intercepts are verified by database, geological and corporate staff.
Black Cat will use twinned holes to assist in verification of historic results from time to time.
All primary data related to logging and sampling is directly entered to Excel templates. All data is sent to Perth and
stored in the centralised Access database with an SQL backend, managed by a database consultant.
No adjustments or calibrations are made to any assay data, apart from resetting below detection values to half
positive detection. First gold assay is utilised for exploration work.

(collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings
and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.
Specification of the grid system used.
Quality and adequacy of topographic control.

All holes have been picked up using a licensed surveyor using RTK-GPS.
Down hole surveys are collected a north seeking gyro.
Black Cat uses the grid system GDA 1994 MGA Zone 51.
RLs have been assigned using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (“SRTM”) digital elevation model, unless
surveyed by RTK-GPS. RTK GPS pickups will be used to build up local topographic models over exploration
areas.
The nominal drill hole spacing is 50m (northing) by 30m (easting).
Drill hole spacing is sufficient.

Data spacing and
distribution

Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to
establish the degree of geological and grade continuity
appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.

Orientation of data in
relation to geological
structure

Whether sample compositing has been applied.

No compositing has been applied.

Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased
sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this
is known, considering the deposit type.

All holes were drilled towards grid east at -60 to intersect the mineralised zones at a close to perpendicular
relationship for the bulk of the deposits.

If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the
orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to
have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed
and reported if material.
The measures taken to ensure sample security.

All drilling from surface has been drilled as close to perpendicular to the predicted orientation of stratigraphy as
possible. This has reduced the risk of introducing a sampling bias as far as possible. No orientation-based
sampling bias has been identified in the data at this point.

Sample security
Audits or reviews

The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques
and data.

Black Cat’s samples prepared on site by Black Cat geological staff. Samples are selected, collected into tied calico
bags and delivered to the laboratory by staff or contractors directly and there are no concerns with sample security.
Black Cat has recently created appropriate sampling procedures.

Commentary

The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along
with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to
operate in the area.

No known impediment to obtaining a licence to operate exists and the remainder of the tenements are in good
standing.

Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other
parties.

General Gold completed Aircore drilling over the immediate area of Myhree in 1992. RAB drilling extending this
line and on additional lines further north were completed by Acacia Resources in 1999. Four shallow RC holes
(TE1-TE4) were drilled by Bulong Mining to follow up anomalous results in the Aircore drilling and no further
exploration is recorded.

Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.

A local prospecting syndicate Bulong Mining Pty Ltd (“BMPL”) secured an option in 2009 and in 2012 fully acquired
the properties and the database. BMPL undertook serious metal detecting and limited RAB/RC drilling until early
2018 when the tenements were acquired by Black Cat.
The Bulong Project is located in the Gindalbie Domain of the Kurnalpi Terrane of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton.
Project-scale geology consists of granite-greenstone lithologies that were metamorphosed to greenschist facies
grade. The Archaean lithologies are cut by Proterozoic dolerite dykes.
The style of mineralisation is Archaean orogenic gold.

Drill hole information

A summary of all information material to the understanding
of the exploration results including a tabulation of the
following information for all Material drill holes:
•

easting and northing of the drill hole collar;

•

elevation or Reduced Level (“RL”) (elevation above sea
level in metres) of the drill hole collar;

•

dip and azimuth of the hole;

•

down hole length and interception depth;

•

hole length; and

Locally the prospects are situated within a sediment and porphyry sequence between ultramafic units.
Tables containing drill hole collar, survey and intersection data are included in the body of the announcement.

if the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis
that the information is not Material and this exclusion
does not detract from the understanding of the report, the
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the
case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg
cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually
Material and should be stated.

All aggregated zones are length weighted.
No high grade cuts have been used.

Commentary

Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and
some typical examples of such aggregations should be
shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.

All intersections are calculated using a minimal sample interval of 0.2m, a 1 g/t Au lower cut-off with maximum
waste zones between grades of 1m, except where stated in the body of the report.

These relationships are particularly important in the reporting
of Exploration Results.

All intercepts are reported as downhole depths as true widths are not yet determined.

If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg
‘down hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations
of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery
being reported These should include, but not be limited to a
plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate
sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration.
Results are not practicable, representative reporting of both
low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious
or contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for
lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale stepout drilling).

Not applicable, as no metal equivalent values have been reported.

Appropriate diagrams have been included in the body of the announcement.

All results have been tabulated in this release.

Geophysical surveys including aeromagnetic surveys have been carried out by previous owners to highlight and
interpret prospective structures in the project area.
SAM surveys have been conducted by GAP Geophysics on 50m spaced lines, oriented 090-270 degrees. SAM
data was interpreted by Southern Geoscience. Targets are based on interpreted zones of lithological and structural
complexity from magnetometric conductivity, relative magnetic intensity and electromagnetic conductivity layers.
Black Cat is continuing an exploration program which will target extension of mineralisation at. Myhree.
