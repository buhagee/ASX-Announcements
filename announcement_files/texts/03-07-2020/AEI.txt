Aeris’ revenue (unaudited) for FY2020 was $14.4 million and exceeded the
previously-provided revenue guidance of $13 million.
The unaudited pre-tax half-year result from January to June 2020 was profitable.
Consumer channel orders were received from major global brands –
Guardian Health and Beauty (Guardian) in Singapore, and Costco
Wholesale Corporation in Japan (Costco).
Initial shipments to Chinese strategic partners are targeted in the current quarter.
Approvals for Aeris Active were granted in Europe following relevant EN
testing (European Standards), confirming key residual claims for
Coronavirus and further demonstrating Aeris’ product differentiation.

Aeris Environmental Ltd (ASX:AEI) (Aeris or the Company) is pleased to announce
that its revenue for the 2019-20 financial year (unaudited) of $14.4 million exceeded its
revenue guidance of $13 million by $1.4 million.
In line with Aeris’ global roll-out, the Company now has its Aeris Active product listed
for sale by the Guardian, the pharmacy division of the Singapore-listed Dairy Farm
International Holdings Limited. The initial orders are for 105 stores across Singapore.
Costco in Japan has over 26 warehouse stores, each of which will be initially stocking
Aeris Active, with an aggregate opening order of $260,000. The Company has worked
closely with Costco’s team to ensure that its marketing claims meet Japanese
requirements, as well as developing a specially-formulated pack size to accommodate
Costco’s position as the leading ‘wholesale members club’. The opportunity with Costco
is significant and Aeris aims to expand its product offering amongst the 787 companyowned warehouse clubs globally.
On 19 May 2020, the Company announced a strategic alliance with a consortium of Chinese
businesses, being Shanghai Taitrust Industrial Group Co., Ltd and Shanxi Tond Chemical
Stock Limited Company (SZ:002360, Shenzhen stock exchange). It is anticipated that initial
stock orders in excess of $1 million will be shipped in the current quarter.
Aeris is pleased to announce that it has had independent testing conducted in Europe
by APEX Bio Solutions in Serre-les-Sapins, France for its proprietary Aeris Active
product. Following the relevant EN testing, Aeris Active achieved success on all
parameters and, specifically, on a seven-day residual Coronavirus claim, validating
