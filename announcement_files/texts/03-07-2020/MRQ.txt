Corridor South Project Auger Drilling Update
MRG Metals (ASX Code:MRQ) is pleased to provide significant laboratory assay results from
auger drilling on the Nhacutse and Bungane targets within the Corridor South tenement
(6621L). This new auger data set for Nhacutse and Bungane confirms the previous visual
estimate data and moreover, further underpins the significant potential for definition of a
new high grade heavy mineral sand (HMS) resource at Nhacutse.
The laboratory results are for a batch of 377 samples (including QAQC samples) from a total
of 50 auger holes, comprising 540m of drilling (Figure 1).
Overall, the laboratory results show all 50 of the holes attained an uncut average downhole
grade >3% THM, with 32 of the 50 holes having an uncut average downhole grade of >4%
THM and 11 holes with >5% THM. There are 16 holes that end in ≥5% THM and there are 7
holes that were collared at surface with grade ≥5% THM.
These laboratory results confirm there is a new high grade HMS mineralised zone emerging
at Nhacutse that remains open in all directions at >4% THM, with a significant higher-grade
core >5% THM. The visual estimated THM% grades reported previously (refer ASX
announcement 9 April 2020) noted the footprint of HMS mineralisation at Nhacutse is about
3km x 1.9km with a long axis northeast-southwest. The new laboratory results support this
previous interpretion, but more importantly define a 2.5km x 1.5km core of >5% average
downhole THM (Figure 1).
At the Bungane target, laboratory results confirm the highest grade auger hole there was
collared at surface in >7% THM. This very high grade zone at Bungane is limited in surface
area, but is surrounded by auger holes with grades that are typically 3.5–4.5% THM.
MRG Chairman, Mr Andrew Van Der Zwan, said “At Nhacutse/Bungane our targeted auger
drilling has generated at least one new aircore drill target to test the potential for very
high grade >5%THM resource from surface to augment Koko Massava in a mine start-up
scenario. The target zone of 4 sqkm delivers another significant follow up target of
potential multi year mine production (already representing circa 100mt) with surface
grades suitable for mill feed with the possibility of continued high grades below (refer
recent Poiombo aircore assay results ASX announcements 18 and 19 June 2020).
Through our rapid and cost-effective auger exploration of the Corridor Central and
Corridor South tenements, we have now identified multiple very high grade aircore
drilling targets from assay results that continue to confirm our strong visual estimates.

We are delighted to be putting ourselves in the position of having such a portfolio of
aircore drill targets with potential to achieve our stated goal of augmenting the impressive
Koko Massava mineral resource with high grade, early mine life potential feed.
All such targets that are identified will be prioritised at completion of the auger drilling,
including comparable targets recently identified within Koko Massava and from recent
aircore drilling success at Poiombo, with a view to an Aircore program later this year to
help us know if there is an even higher grade start-up resource to develop in the Corridor
projects before Koko Massava. We continue to gain momentum towards this objective
with the ongoing exploration success we are enjoying in the Corridor mineral province.”

Nhacutse Target Auger Sample Laboratory Results
The auger drilling data reported here forms part of a program of broad-spaced holes at
250m to 500m stations on traverses 500m to 1000m apart and designed to test geophysical
anomalies.
The best hole returned within this new laboratory batch for Nhacutse target is 20CSHA288,
which is located in north-central part of the target and returned 12m @ 5.98% THM (from
0.0–12m). This hole ended in 6.38% THM (10.5m–12.0m) which was also the maximum
individual grade from the hole (Table 1; Figure 1). Slime values related to hole 20CSHA288
are moderate, with a range of 11.72%–24.23% and an average of 18.58%.
The next best result is from hole 20CSHA347, located about 700m south of hole 20CSHA288
(Figure 1), comprising 12m @ 5.67% THM uncut from surface to 12m. The hole was collared
(0.0–1.5m) in 5.3% THM and ended at the 10.5–12m interval with a grade of 5.99% THM.
Slime for this hole has an average of 19.35%.
Also, significant in the new data for Nhacutse is hole 20CSHA309, located at the southwest
end of the high grade zone. The hole comprises an uncut downhole average of 5.60% THM,
from 0.0–10.5m (Table 1; Figure 1). Hole 20CSHA309 has a peak grade of 6.28% THM in the
sample interval 7.5–9.0m and ended at 10.5m in 5.54% THM. Slime values have a range
12.45%–25.20%, with an average of 20.59%.
The oversize fraction characteristics of the auger sample batch reported here for the
Nhacutse target have a range from 0.24%–1.54%, with a low average of 0.70%.
In terms of visual results versus laboratory results for the downhole THM grade averages,
the range of absolute variance is 0.04%–1.60% THM. The average visual grade was over
estimated in only 11 of the holes, with the over estimation only between 0.14%–1.09%. The
average visual grade in the remainder of holes was typically under estimated by only <0.5%
THM.

For personal use only

The consistency of high grade auger holes with >5% THM downhole average, large footprint
of the HMS mineralisation and near surface nature of the mineralisation suggest the
Nhacutse target could yield another significant HMS discovery for the Company at the
Corridor projects.
Additional auger sample results from the remainder of holes in the Nhacutse target,
particularly on the east side, will be reported as soon as the sample batch is available and
data has been validated and interpreted.
Composite samples for mineral assemblage characterisation by Qemscan analysis for the
Nhacutse target are currently being prepared, and will be reported when available.

Bungane Target Auger Sample Laboratory Results
The Bungane target contains the highest grade auger hole for this sample batch and the
highest average grade auger hole drilled to date by the Company on the Corridor projects.
Hole 20CSHA312 comprises 12m @ 7.8% THM (Table 1). This hole was collared at surface in
7.66% THM and had a peak grade of 8.11% THM in the interval 9.0–10.5m. The sample
interval 4.5–6.0m also contained an excellent result of 8.02% THM. The hole ended in 7.79%
THM from 10.5–12m (Table 2). Slimes values for this high grade hole are relatively low, with
a range of 11.82%–17.47% and average of 14.87%, which is an encouraging result.
Hole 20CSHA312 correlates directly with the north end of a discrete high intensity thorium
anomaly 1.3km X 0.5km (refer ASX announcement 9 April 2020). Hole 20CSHA330 was
drilled at the south end of this same anomaly and yielded 10.5m @ 3.79% THM, which
suggests the very high grade mineralisation noted in hole 20CSHA312 may be relatively
localized or may not have been intersected in the south due to the hole being collared a
higher elevation.
The second most significant hole, 20CSHA298, at Bungane is located at the north end of the
broader target area and includes a laboratory result of 10.5m @ 4.99% THM. This hole had a
peak grade of 5.63% THM in the final sample interval of 9.0–10.5m. Slime levels are slightly
higher in this hole than is typical for the Corridor area, with a range of 15.99%–31.58% and
average of 24.43%.
A comparison of visual results versus laboratory results for the downhole THM grade
averages, shows the range of absolute variance is 0.12%–0.92% THM. The average visual
grade was typically over estimated, however as noted the variance was <1% THM.
While the results for Bungane target show a relatively localized high grade zone, given the
near-surface nature, very high grades, and consistency of the grade downhole (all samples
>7% THM from surface), this area warrants further follow-up drilling.

Auger Drilling Details
Auger holes were selected for laboratory analysis by filtering average downhole visual
estimated THM%, with only samples from those holes attaining ≥3% average visual THM
being selected for laboratory analysis.
Auger samples were sent to Western GeoLabs in Perth for heavy liquid separation analysis.
Samples were initially oven dried and disaggregated if required by hand, weighed and then
split to approximately 100g sub-samples. The sub-sample was wetted and attritioned to
ensure further breakdown of any clay aggregates and then de-slimed at 45µm to measure
Slime percent. The sub-sample was then screened at +1mm to remove and measure
Oversize percent. The +45µm-1mm fraction was then subjected to heavy liquid separation
(HLS) with tetrabromoethane (TBE) at specific gravity of 2.95. The settling time for HLS was
45 minutes with several stirs of the liquid to ensure adequate heavy mineral ‘drop’.
In terms of QAQC, field duplicate samples are prepared at a frequency of 1 per 25 primary
samples and submitted ‘blind’ to the laboratory. A Standard Reference Material (SRM)
sample was inserted into the field sample batch at a frequency of 1 per 50 primary samples.
At the laboratory, additional duplicates are routinely prepared at a frequency of 1 per 10
primary samples.

Appendix 1
JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria
Sampling
techniques

JORC Code explanation
• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or
specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate
to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity
and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the
Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be
relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1
m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge
for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.

Commentary
• A sample of sand, approximately 20g, was scooped from the sample
bag of each sample interval for wet panning and visual estimation.
• The same sample mass is used for every pan sample visual
estimation.
• The consistent sized pan sample is to ensure visual calibration is
maintained for consistency in percentage visual estimation of total
heavy mineral (THM).
• Geotagged photographs are taken of each panned sample with the
corresponding sample bag to enable easy reference at a later date
• The larger 1.5m interval auger drill samples were homogenized prior
to being grab sampled for panning.
• The large 1.5m drill samples have an average of about 4kg and were
split down in Mozambique to approximately 300-600g by riffle splitter
for export to the Primary processing laboratory.
• At the laboratory the 300-600g laboratory sample was dried and split
to 100g, de-slimed (removal of -45µm fraction) and oversize (+1mm
fraction) removed, then subjected to heavy liquid separation using
TBE to determine total heavy mineral (THM) content.

Drilling
techniques

• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air
blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple
or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).

• Hand Auger drilling is a manual hand operated system produced by
Dormer Engineering in Australia.
• Drill rods and drill bits are 1m long.
• The auger is a 62mm open hole drilling technique.
• All holes have been drilled vertically.
• The drilling onsite is governed by a Hand Auger Drilling Guideline to
ensure consistency in application of the method.
• A wooden surface collar is placed on the ground at the beginning of
each hole to prevent widening of the collar and material falling into
the hole.

Drill sample
recovery

• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries
and results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure

• Auger drilling is considered to be an early stage relatively
unsophisticated technique of drilling.
• The auger drill used is an open hole method and recovery of sample

Criteria

JORC Code explanation
representative nature of the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade
and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential
loss/gain of fine/coarse material.

Commentary
extracted from the holes is measured by spring balance at the drill
site.
• Samples are consistently collected at 1.5m intervals.
• No significant losses of auger sample were observed due to the
shallow depths of drilling (<12m).
• The initial 0–1.5m interval in each auger hole is drilled with care to
maximize sample recovery.
• There is potential for contamination in open hole drilling techniques
but sample bias is not likely due to the shallow drill hole depths.

Logging

• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate
Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical
studies.
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or
costean, channel, etc) photography.
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.

Sub-sampling
techniques
and sample
preparation

• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core
taken.
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and
whether sampled wet or dry.
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the
sample preparation technique.
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to
maximise representivity of samples.
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in
situ material collected, including for instance results for field
duplicate/second-half sampling.
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material
being sampled.

• The 1.5m auger drill intervals were logged onto paper field log sheets
prior to transcribing into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
• The auger samples were logged for lithology, colour, grainsize,
rounding, sorting, estimated %THM, estimated %slimes and any
relevant comments, such as slope and vegetation.
• Geological logging is governed by a Hand Auger Drilling Guideline
with predefined log codes and guidance of what to include in log
fields to ensure consistency between individuals logging data.
• Data is backed-up each day at the field base to a cloud storage site.
• Data from the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets is imported into a
Microsoft Access database and the data is subjected to numerous
validation queries to ensure data quality.
• The 1.5m drill sample composites were homogenized at the drill site
and then cone-and-quarter split onsite and inserted into clean calico
sample bags with metal sample tag according to the Hand Auger
Drilling Guideline.
• At the field base, the samples were homogenized within the calico
bag by rotating it and then fed through a single tier riffle splitter that is
placed on a hard surface and leveled, to reduce samples to 300-600g
sub-samples for export to the Primary processing laboratory.
• The 300-600g sub-sample is deposited into a new labeled calico
sample bag with metal sample tag and prepared to be sent to the
Primary laboratory for analysis.
• Where samples were wet when sampled, they were dried in clean
plastic basins prior to riffle splitting.
• All of the samples collected have been sand or silty-sand and the
preparation techniques are considered appropriate for this sample
type.
• The sample sizes were deemed suitable based on industry
experience of the geologists involved and consultation with laboratory

laboratory
tests

• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and
laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered
partial or total.
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc,
the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument
make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their

staff.
• Field duplicates of the samples were completed at a rate of 5%, or at
a frequency of approximately 1 per 25 primary samples.
• Standard Reference Material (SRM) samples are inserted into the
sample stream in the field at a frequency of 1 per 50 samples.
• Employees undertaking the primary sampling and splitting are closely
monitored by a geologist to ensure sampling quality is maintained.
• The wet panning of samples provides an estimate of the %THM
content within the sample which was sufficient for the purpose of
determining approximate concentrations of THM.
• The field derived visual panned THM estimates are compared to a
range of laboratory derived THM images of pan concentrates. This
allows the field geologists to calibrate the field panned visual
estimated THM with known laboratory measured THM grades.
Laboratory Analysis Methodology
• The individual 300-600g auger sub-samples were sent to Western
GeoLabs in Perth, Western Australia, which is considered the Primary
laboratory.
• The 300-600g auger samples were first oven dried, disaggregated to
break up any clay balls, and riffle split to 100g sub-samples. They
were then wetted and attritioned and screened for removal and
determination of Slimes (-45µm) and Oversize (+1mm) contents.
• The +45um-1mm sample fraction was then analysed for THM%
content by heavy liquid separation (HLS).
• The laboratory used TBE as the heavy liquid medium for HLS – with
density 2.95 g/ml, measured daily.
• This is an industry standard technique for HLS to determine THM in
HMS exploration.
• Field duplicates of the auger samples were collected at a frequency
of 1 per 25 primary samples and submitted ‘blind’ to the Primary
laboratory with the field sample batch.
• Western GeoLabs completed its own internal QA/QC checks that
included laboratory repeats every 10th sample prior to the results
being released.
• Analysis of the Company and laboratory QA/QC samples show the
laboratory data to be of acceptable accuracy and precision.
• The adopted QA/QC protocols are acceptable for this stage test work.

Criteria
Verification of
sampling and
assaying

JORC Code explanation
• The verification of significant intersections by either independent or
alternative company personnel.
• The use of twinned holes.
• Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data
verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data.

Commentary
• Selected visual estimated THM field data are checked by the Chief
Geologist.
• Significant visual estimated THM >5% are verified by the Chief
Geologist. This is done either in the field or via field photographs of
the pan sample.
• The Chief Geologist makes regular visits to the field drill sites to
check on process and procedure.
• No twinned holes have been completed due to the early nature of the
auger drilling technique.
• The field data has been manually transcribed into a master Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet which is appropriate for this early stage in the
exploration program. Data is then imported into a Microsoft Access
database where it is subjected to various validation queries.
• Test work has not yet been undertaken at a Secondary laboratory to
check the veracity of the Primary laboratory data. This work is
planned as part of the Company’s standard QA/QC procedure.
• A process of laboratory data validation using mass balance is
undertaken to identify entry errors or questionable data.
• Field and laboratory duplicate data pairs (THM/oversize/slime) of
each batch are plotted to identify potential quality control issues.

data points

• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and
down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations
used in Mineral Resource estimation.
• Specification of the grid system used.
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control.

• Downhole surveys for shallow auger holes are not required due to the
very shallow nature.
• A handheld 16 channel Garmin GPS was used to record the positions
of the auger holes in the field.
• The handheld Garmin GPS has an accuracy of +/- 5m.
• The datum used for coordinates is WGS84 zone 36S.
• The accuracy of the drillhole locations is sufficient for this early stage
exploration.

Data spacing
and
distribution

• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
• Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the
degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral
Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and
classifications applied.
• Whether sample compositing has been applied.

• Auger holes were typically drilled at 250m, 500m and 1000m between
hole stations and 500m between station lines for reconnaissance
drilling.
• The reconnaissance auger hole spacing was systematic and hole
locations were designed to test for heavy mineral sand mineralisation
related to geophysical anomalism.
• The data has not been used for resource estimation.

Orientation of

• The exploration work was completed on the Corridor South tenement
(6621L) which is 100% owned by the Company through its 100%
ownership of its subsidiary, Sofala Mining & Exploration Limitada, in
Mozambique.
• All granted tenements have initial 5 year terms, renewable for 3
years. An application for renewal of tenement 6621L was submitted in
23 September 2019 and is under review. Additional supporting
information was requested by the Ministry of Mineral Resources on
14 April 2020 and this was submitted by the Company on 29 April,
2020.
• Traditional landowners and village Chiefs within the areas of influence
were consulted prior to the auger programme and were supportive of
the programme.
• An Environment Management Plan was prepared by an independent
consultant and submitted to the Provincial Directorate of Lands,
Environment and Rural Development in accordance with Mining Law
and Regulations.
• An Environmental License has been obtained by the Company.
• Representatives from the Provincial Directorate of Mineral Resources
and Directorate of Lands, Environment and Rural Development, and
District Planning and Infrastructure Departments are also part of the
consent and consultation process.

Exploration
done by other
parties

• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.

• Historic exploration work was completed by Corridor Sands Limitada,
a subsidiary of Southern Mining Corporation and subsequently
Western Mining Corporation, in 1999. BHP-Billiton acquired Western
Mining Corporation and undertook a Bankable Feasibility Study of the
Corridor Deposit 1 about 15km north of the Company’s tenements.
• The Company has obtained digital data in relation to this historic
information.
• The historic data comprises limited Aircore/Reverse Circulation
drilling.
• The historic results are not reportable under JORC 2012.

Geology

• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.

• Two types of heavy mineral sand mineralisation styles are possible
along coastal Mozambique:

JORC Code explanation

Commentary
1. Thin but high grade strandlines which may be related to marine
or fluvial influences, and
2. Large but lower grade deposits related to windblown sands.
• The coastline of Mozambique is well known for massive dunal
systems such as those developed near Inhambane (Rio Tinto’s
Mutamba deposit), near Xai Xai (Rio Tinto’s Chilubane deposit) and
in Nampula Province (Kenmare’s Moma deposit). Buried strandlines
are likely in areas where palaeoshorelines can be defined along
coastal zones.

Data
aggregation
methods

• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the
exploration results including a tabulation of the following information
for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from
the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly
explain why this is the case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used
for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of
such aggregations should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.

Relationship
between
mineralisation
widths and
intercept
lengths

• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true
width not known’).
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.

• Auger holes are thought to represent close to true thicknesses of the
mineralisation.
• Downhole widths are reported.

• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential
deleterious or contaminating substances.
• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions,
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas,
provided this information is not commercially sensitive.

• No other material exploration information has been gathered by the
Company.
