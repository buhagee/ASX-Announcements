YOUANMI GOLD PROJECT
RC DRILLING COMMENCES AT PENNY WEST DEEP SOUTH &
SOVEREIGN PROSPECTS

Venus Metals Corporation Limited (“Venus” or the “Company”) in conjunction with its Joint
Venture partner Rox Resources Limited (ASX: RXL) is pleased to announce that a reverse
circulation (RC) drill program commences at the Penny West Deep South and Sovereign
prospects.


Penny West Deep South Gold Prospect – RC drilling targets high‐priority Heli‐borne
EM (HEM) anomalies (refer ASX release 12 March 2020), located on E57/1078 c. 4km
south of the historical Penny West Gold mine (Figure 1). The HEM anomalies may
indicate sulphide mineralization potentially associated with gold of the Penny West‐
type of mineralization. RC drilling will also test the bedrock mineralization beneath
anomalous gold reported from historical RAB drilling that has not been followed up.



Sovereign Gold Prospect – Previous aircore (AC) drilling on E57/1019 discovered a
new zone of gold mineralization (Sovereign Gold Prospect – Figure 2) of 4m @ 7.02
g/t Au from 24m, and 5m @ 2.41 g/t Au from 60m to EOH in VRAC151 (refer ASX
releases 15 October 2019 and 4 November 2019). Follow‐up RC drilling beneath the
gold intersection in the AC holes confirmed the gold mineralization with best results
of 3m @ 6.61 g/t Au from 78m in YSRC05 including 1m @ 11.61 g/t Au from 79m,
and 3m @ 1.98 g/t Au from 61m. AC drilling to the south extended the gold
mineralization with a best result of 8m @ 1.92g/t from 28m in VRAC173 (refer ASX
release 28 Nov 2019).

The current RC program is testing the depth and along-strike extensions of this new
zone of gold mineralization.


Planned regional aircore program
Further to the current RC program, AC drilling (approx. 4,000m) will also commence
shortly. The AC program will target the Penny West Deep South and the Pincher
North

Gold

(VMC 45% ‐ RXL 45% ‐ Prospector 10%). At the Pincher North Gold Prospect (Figure
2), a sample of remnant drill spoil (not representative) from a historical drill hole
assayed 26.4 g/t Au in vein quartz and saprolite chips (see ASX release 19 June 2020)
with no historical follow-up drilling apparent. At the Currans Find Gold Prospect
(Currans JV - VMC 45% ‐ RXL 45% ‐ Prospector 10%), AC drilling will test an intrusion
that was identified by a recent ground magnetic survey (refer ASX release 19 June
2020) and that may be related to diorite / granodiorite associated with gold
mineralization at the Red White and Blue Prospect (Figure 2).

Exploration Targets
The term ‘Exploration Target’ should not be misunderstood or misconstrued as an estimate of Mineral
Resources and Reserves as defined by the JORC Code (2012), and therefore the terms have not been
used in this context.
Forward-Looking Statements
This document may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are
not limited to, statements concerning Venus Metals Corporation Limited planned exploration program
and other statements that are not historical facts. When used in this document, the words such as
"could," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may”, "potential," "should," and similar expressions
are forward-looking statements. Although Venus Metals Corporation Ltd believes that its expectations
reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements involve risks and
uncertainties and no assurance can be given that actual results will be consistent with these forwardlooking statements.
Competent Person’s Statement
The information in this report that relates to Exploration Results, Mineral Resources or Ore Resources
is based on information compiled by Dr M. Cornelius, Geological Consultant of Venus Metals
Corporation Ltd, who is a member of The Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG). Dr Cornelius has
sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under
consideration and to the activity that he is undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in
the 2012 Edition of the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Australasian Code for Reporting of
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Dr Cornelius consents to the inclusion in the
report of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.
