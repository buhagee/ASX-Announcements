AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT
3 JUNE 2020
Pernatty IOCG* Project – Drilling Programme
Drilling of up to 8 targets arranged for August 2020
Possible New Priority Targets Identified
(* IOCG – Iron/Oxide-Copper-Gold)

Drilling at Tasman’s 100% owned Pernatty IOCG project, located on the Gawler Craton approx.
20km south east of the Carrapateena deposit in South Australia (refer Figure 1), is scheduled to
commence in August 2020. Up to eight targets identified from geophysical surveys are proposed to
be drilled.

EM surveying over priority gravity and magnetic targets (refer TAS:ASX announcement 7 January
2019) identified within the Pernatty IOCG project, was completed, including follow up surveys, in
December last year. A total of 54.7 line km were surveyed over the two target areas (refer Figure 2
and TAS:ASX announcement 20 January 2020). The aim of the survey was to locate anomalous
areas of electrical conductivity in the basement that could be due to sulphide mineralisation, as well
as give information about depth to basement.

New EM Data Analysis and Modelling
Previous geophysical modelling of the EM data in the northern area (refer Figure 2) in conjunction
with the available gravity and magnetic data has recently been reviewed by Tasman’s consultant
geophysicist after analysis of what was previously thought to be spurious EM data along one of the
surveyed lines.

ASX Announcement: 3 June 2020

An anomalous segment of EM survey line 6524000N (refer Figure 2) between 751100E and 751600E was
resurveyed by the contractor in December, 2019, only to find, that the anomalous effects were no longer
obvious and normal polarization-free readings were observed. The geophysical report was written assuming
that the second data set was correct and the earlier one was spurious; however, a question remained regarding
the veracity of the data. Logically, one or the other, or both surveys seemingly had to be wrong and after a
thorough analysis Tasman’s consultant geophysicist believes that both may have been correct but subject to
different conditions.
The geophysicist now believes that the anomalous readings on the first survey were most likely due to
polarisation effects due to a higher current in a two turn transmitter loop which was not detected by the second
survey which may have used only a one turn loop and hence a lower transmitter current (AMIRA TEM format
does not include provision for recording the number of turns in a transmitter loop).
As a result the questionable segment of line is to be re-surveyed, within the next few weeks, with one reading
being taken with a single turn loop and a second reading to be taken when feeding the same current into a twoturn loop.
Modelling of the EM results from the first survey on Line 6524000N (Figures 3&4) has recently been
completed and three additional high priority drilling targets have been delineated, assuming of course that the
data from the anomalous segment of the first EM survey is reliable.

ASX Announcement: 3 June 2020

Figure 4: Line 6524000N, best model fit of EM data shown in Figure 3, showing modelled
conductive plates .

Tasman’s geophysicist has concluded that the modelled flat lying polarizable Plate_01 (refer Figure
4) may represent sulphides in relatively shallow porous rocks of the Adelaidean cover sequence such
as the Whyalla Sandstone if present, and possibly of similar style to the copper sulphides at Mt
Gunson, 40km to the west. The deeper rocks represented by Plate_02 and Plate_04 may represent a
deeper source for any base metal sulphide accumulations here.
Modelled Plates_02 and Plate_04 coincide laterally as well as depth-wise, with dense and magnetic
bodies recognised in the density-magnetic susceptibility model for the area and are priority targets
for IOCG copper sulphide mineralisation (refer Figure 4 and gravity and magnetic profiles in Figure
3).
Drilling Program
Subject to a successful capital raising Tasman is proposing to drill some or all of the eight EM ±
gravity-magnetic targets (refer Figure 2) in the September quarter. Should the earlier EM data from
Line 6524000N prove to be reliable Tasman would view the targets on this line as of the highest
priority.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES ARE PROVIDED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE
JORC CODE (2012 EDITION) FOR THE REPORTING OF EXPLORATION RESULTS.
PERNATTY PROJECT
Section 1 Sampling techniques and data
(criteria in this group apply to all succeeding groups)

Criteria
Sampling
techniques.

JORC Code explanation


Nature and quality of sampling (EG cut
channels, random chips or specific specialised
industry standard measurement tools
appropriate to the minerals under investigation,
such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld
XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.



Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.



Aspects of the determination of mineralisation
that are Material to the Public Report. In cases
where “industry standard” work has been done
this would be relatively simple (eg “reverse
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m
samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to
produce a 30g charge for fire assay”). In other
cases more explanation may be required, such as
where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may
warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (eg. core, reverse circulation, openhole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka
etc.) and details (eg. core diameter, triple or
standard tube, depth of diamond tails, facesampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc.).
Whether core and chip sample recoveries have
been properly recorded and results assessed.

Drilling techniques.



Drill sample
recovery.



Logging.



Measures taken to maximise sample recovery
and ensure representative nature of the samples.



Whether a relationship exists between sample
recovery and grade and whether sample bias
may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain
of fine/coarse material.
Whether core and chip samples have been
logged to a level of detail to support appropriate
Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and
metallurgical studies.



Commentary


No drilling or sampling is reported. A
moving loop ground EM survey was
carried out. An EMIT SMARTem 24
receiver was used to take all of the EM
data. Data were sensed using a 3component RVR coil. Transmitted fields
were generated with a Zonge GGT30
geophysical transmitter powered by
aZMG-30 genset. MLEM output
current/ramp times were around
38A/640μs at 1Hz for most of the
survey. An EMIT transmitter controller
was used to control transmitter wave
form and was synchronised via GPS.
The double-turn, 200x200m transmitter
loop was constructed using insulated
4mm2 multistrand copper wire.



For each station at least three blocks or
stacks of data were acquired (more
blocks or stacks if there was a noisy
decay) to allow editing and assessment
of data repeatability.

Commentary


Exploration Licence No 6137 is located
approximately 80km ESE of Woomera in
South Australia and is owned 100% by
Tasman Resources Ltd.
There are no joint ventures, partnerships or
royalties involved. The EL is covered by the
Kokatha Native Title Claim Settlement ILUA
S12014/011 and agreements between the
claimants and Tasman designed to protect
Aboriginal heritage sites. There are no
historical or wilderness sites or national
parks or known environmental settings.



Tasman has secure tenure over the EL at
the time of reporting and there are no known
impediments to obtaining a licence to
operate in the area.



Very little previous exploration has been
carried out within the tenement area. This
work appears to have been confined to
government gravity and magnetic surveys
and some limited infill gravity surveying by a
previous explorer.
The type of deposit sought is an iron-oxide,
copper gold type system (IOCG), similar to
the Carrapateena deposit, about 20km to the
NW. Carrapateena occurs within basement
rocks beneath approximately 400m of
younger, flat-lying sedimentary cover rocks.





No drilling has been completed within
Tasman’s EL6137 and hence subsurface
geology and depth to older basement in the
tenement are uncertain at this stage.

true width not known’).
Where possible, maps and sections (with
scales) and tabulations of intercepts should
be included for any material discovery being
reported if such diagrams significantly
clarify the report.
Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and high
grades and/or widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including (but
not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples - size and method
of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.
