About MyFiziq
Our mission is to globalize our technology and assist individuals, communities and populations live
better healthier lives by working with governments, healthcare providers and the best health & fitness
identities and solutions available worldwide with the data we can provide in the palm of their hands.
Our software as a service solution (SAAS) offering allows flexibility and pricing scale reductions for
our partners. MyFiziq partners with highly scaled or scalable new and existing applications and provides
them with a deeper insight into the data they wish to retrieve from their users to empower them in their
journeys.
Consumers engage daily with multiple needs that require the use or ability to track individual
dimensions. Such as dieting, exercising, assessing their health, or simply buying clothing online, the
result is a drive toward understanding their personal dimensions or the changes they are undergoing.
MyFiziq provides the missing link in other ecosystems.
MyFiziq is a globally patented technology we have developed with a proprietary image capturing
system within a smartphone, we empower an ability to create a representation of an individual’s
structure in the form of a 3D avatar with accurate circumference measurements. Organizations embed
our technology into their new or existing applications and then customize the experience to meet their
brand and functional requirements.
MyFiziq has developed this capability by leveraging the power of Computer Vision, Machine Learning,
and patented algorithms, to process these images on secure, enterprise-level infrastructure, delivering
an end-to-end experience that is unrivalled in the industry. Body measurements provide more important
information about health, risk and physical change than simply measuring weight.
MyFiziq simplifies the collection of these measurements, conveniently and cost effectively, whilst
removing the margin of human error present in traditional methods.
