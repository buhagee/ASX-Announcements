ASX Announcement
9 July 2020

For personal use only

Black Cat Syndicate Limited (“Black Cat” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce an update on
activities at the Bulong Gold Project (“Bulong”), including results from recent RC drilling.
HIGHLIGHTS
−

−

−

−

Recent RC drilling at Myhree has returned numerous zones of shallow, thick, high-grade
mineralisation. Holes were drilled to infill shallow parts of the Resource ahead of potential open
pit mining operations. Results include:
−

8m @ 26.43 g/t Au from 55m (20MYRC043);

−

10m @ 5.60 g/t Au from 10m (20MYRC030);

−

6m @ 7.69 g/t Au from 27m (20MYRC032);

−

10m @ 4.12 g/t Au from 28m (20MYRC042);

−

5m @ 8.19 g/t Au from 5m (20MYRC040); and

−

6m @ 6.60 g/t Au from 24m (20MYRC044).

RC drilling at Trump North has also returned additional intersections of shallow mineralisation,
including:
−

1m @ 12.70 g/t Au from 42m (20TRRC012); and

−

8m @ 2.23 g/t Au from 61m (20TRRC015).

Encouragingly, exploration drilling 600m further along the Trump corridor also intersected
mineralisation, including:
−

3m @ 3.27 g/t Au from 95m (20RERC101).

All approvals have been received for the Myhree Stage 1 Open Pit. Black Cat now has full
approval to commence the first stage of open pit mining at Bulong. Details on potential mining
at Myhree will be incorporated in the Myhree Feasibility Study, due in the September 2020
quarter.

Black Cat’s Managing Director, Gareth Solly said:

“The continued shallow, high-grade results bode well for early cashflow from potential mining
operations at Myhree. These results infill the existing Resource and are among the best widths and
grades to date. This is testament to the robust nature of the Myhree deposit. In addition, an important
step in our objective to develop Bulong has been achieved with the full approval of the Stage 1 Open
Pit at Myhree. We also saw some encouragement from an east-west structure at Myhree and 600m
north of Trump north that requires follow up. RC drilling to further test and extend these areas will
recommence during August 2020. In the meantime, diamond drilling of the deeper Mhyree
mineralisation, is currently underway.”

Myhree (M25/024) 100%

For personal use only

The program consisted of 31 infill RC holes for 1,336m and was concentrated in two areas of the
Resource being converted from Inferred to Indicated. This drilling has added further geological data
to the Myhree Feasibility Study. Results include:
−

5m @ 8.19 g/t Au from 5m (20MYRC040) – North area;

−

10m @ 4.12 g/t Au from 28m (20MYRC042) – North area;

−

8m @ 26.43 g/t Au from 55m (20MYRC043) – North area;

−

6m @ 6.60 g/t Au from 24m (20MYRC044) – North area;

−

4m @ 8.58 g/t Au from 25m (20MYRC045) – North area;

−

10m @ 3.65 g/t Au from 16m (20MYRC027) – South area;

−

5m @ 6.16 g/t Au from 10m (20MYRC029) – South area;

−

10m @ 5.60 g/t Au from 10m (20MYRC030) – South area; and

−

6m @ 7.69 g/t Au from 27m (20MYRC032) – South area.

Results from this drilling show that shallow, thick, high-grades were found in modelled positions in
the two main areas tested (Figure 1). The results will be added to the Resource model and the
Myhree Feasibility Study during the September 2020 quarter.
In addition, selected holes were drilled with a northerly azimuth to further test an east-west structure
identified in previous drilling. Results show that a zone of mineralisation extends further east than
previously thought. Results include:
−

1m @ 11.40 g/t Au from 18m (20MYRC036);

−

2m @ 1.40 g/t Au from 21m (20MYRC036);

−

1m @ 11.20 g/t Au from 21m (20MYRC037); and

−

6m @ 2.06 g/t Au from 24m (20MYRC037).

Additional drilling is planned to test and extend results in this area during August 2020.

Trump (M25/024, M25/091, P25/2286) 100%

The Trump North program comprised 6 shallow, infill RC holes for 360m within the 1.1km long Trump
Resource (Figure 2). Drilling was successful in delineating high-grade mineralisation in line with
expectations. Results include:
−

1m @ 12.7 g/t Au from 42m (20TRRC012);

−

2m @ 5.43 g/t Au from 67m (20TRRC013);

Regional Exploration (M25/129, M25/091, E25/520) 100%

For personal use only

Exploration targets were tested by 20 RC holes for 2,050m. Holes were planned along a stratigraphic
target at Fenceline, a structural target on the Trump Corridor (west of Boundary) and an area of
historic workings on the Queen Margaret Corridor (east of Myhree). Better results include:
−

3m @ 3.27 g/t Au from 95m (20RERC101) - Trump Corridor;

−

4m @ 2.98 g/t Au from 48m (20RERC106) - Queen Margaret Corridor; and

−

4m @ 1.96 g/t Au from 72m (20FLRC004) - Fenceline.

The mineralisation intersected on the Trump Corridor (a fresh rock intersection of 3m @ 3.27 g/t Au)
occurs 300m west of Boundary. One line of historic RAB drilling, with anomalous gold, separates
this new zone from Trump North, 600m to the south. Further drilling is required to test this
prospective zone. If proven, this would extend Trump by 50% to an overall strike of >1,800m.
The RC drilling at Fenceline was planned to test an early stage north trending stratigraphic target at
the eastern side of an area of gold anomalism that extends north for >3km through to Anomaly 38.
Four holes were completed with three intersecting mineralisation. Follow up drilling will occur to
further advance the Fenceline prospect during the December 2020 quarter.
Boundary Drilling (M25/129, M25/091) 100%

Three RC infill holes for 300m were drilled to test an area of structural complexity between Boundary
and Boundary South. This area contains a large NW trending fault which offsets mineralisation.
Drilling shows anomalous gold associated with this structure with a best intercept of:
−

2m @ 2.19 g/t Au from 72m (20BORC025).

Sterilisation Drilling (M25/024, M25/129) 100%

An RC sterilisation program consisting of 7 holes for 475m was drilled to further test in areas of
potential infrastructure to the north of Myhree. Narrow zones with moderate grade were intersected
showing that while one of the Myhree structures extends through this zone, it is unlikely to become
economic and the area may be used for mining infrastructure.
Myhree Stage 1: Open Pit Mining Proposal

The Myhree Stage 1 open pit is the initial stage in a multi-stage mining operation at Myhree. The
Stage 1 pit is a “proof of concept” operation to ensure the geological, metallurgical and geotechnical
assumptions perform as expected before committing to larger-scale mining operations.

The Myhree Stage 1 open pit now has all statutory approvals in place to commence operation
(including, but not limited to, the Mining Proposal, Project Management Plan, Mine Closure Plan,
Native Vegetation Clearing Permit and 5C Groundwater Abstraction License).
Full details of the multi-stage operation at Myhree will be discussed in the Myhree Feasibility Study,
scheduled for release in the September 2020 quarter.
The conceptual layout for Myhree Stage 1 is shown below.

ABOUT BLACK CAT SYNDICATE (ASX:BC8)

For personal use only

Black Cat controls 491km2 of highly prospective tenements to the east of the world class mining
centre of Kalgoorlie, WA. The three main project areas include:
−

Bulong Gold Project (“Bulong”), including Yarri East, comprises ~350km² of land located 2550km east of Kalgoorlie. The combined leases capture in excess of 45km of prospective
stratigraphic and structural targets with minimal modern exploration. Advanced deposits
undergoing mining studies along with early stage exploration opportunities exist throughout
the Project;

−

Fingals Gold Project (“Fingals”) comprises ~100km2 of land located ~30km south east of
Bulong. This area contains multiple recently mined Resources and extensive areas of historic
mining and limited modern exploration; and

−

Rowe’s Find Gold Project (“Rowe’s Find”) comprises ~41km2 of land located ~100km east of
Bulong. This project contains JORC 2004 Resources and drill ready targets on an overlooked
greenstone belt.

Bulong, Fingals and Rowe’s Find contain JORC 2004 and 2012 Mineral Resource Estimates
(“Resources”). Under the ASX reporting guidelines we can only quote the acquired JORC 2004
Resources once prior to re-releasing them under JORC 2012 with appropriate additional disclosures
and hence shareholders are referred to our ASX announcement dated 28 May 2020.
Existing infrastructure proximal to Bulong, Fingals and Rowe’s Find presents significant opportunities
for mining operations.

Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria

JORC Code Explanation

Commentary

Sampling techniques

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report. In cases where ‘industry
standard’ work has been done this would be relatively
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m
samples from which 3kg was pulverised to produce a 30g
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may
be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has
inherent sampling problems.

Black Cat has recently undertaken sampling activities at Myhree, Trump, Boundary and regional exploration drilling
via RC.

Drilling techniques

Drill sample recovery

Logging

Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample
recoveries and results assessed.
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and
grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.
Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support
appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies
and metallurgical studies.

Recent RC undertaken by Black Cat provides high quality representative samples that are carried out to industry
standard and include QAQC standards. All samples are weighed in the laboratory.
Black Cat’s recent RC drilling is sampled into 1m intervals via a cone splitter on the rig producing a representative
sample of approximately 3kg. Samples are selected to weigh less than 3kg to ensure total sample inclusion at the
pulverisation stage. 4m composites, taken with a sampling spear, are used in areas of early stage exploration, with
samples >0.09 g/t resplit into the original 1m intervals produced at the time of drilling.
All samples are crushed, dried and pulverised to a nominal 90% passing 75µm to produce a 40g or 50g sub sample
for analysis by FA/AAS.

RC drilling was completed using a face sampling percussion hammer. The RC bit size was 143mm diameter.

RC samples are checked visually. Recoveries for recent RC drilling have been recorded based on laboratory
weights. It is unknown if historic recoveries were recorded.
RC sample recovery and representivity were maintained through industry standard maintenance of the cone splitter
and verified through the use of duplicate samples.
There is no known bias between sample recovery and grade.

Logging of RC chips record lithology, mineralogy, texture, mineralisation, weathering, colour, alteration and veining.
Chips from all Black Cat’s RC holes are stored in chip trays and photographed for future reference. These chip
trays are archived in Kalgoorlie.

Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature.

Commentary
All recent drilling has been logged in full.
No sampling in this report.
All Black Cat’s RC sampling to date have been cone split to 1m increments on the rig. All samples to date have
been dry.
The laboratory preparation of samples adheres to industry best practice. It is conducted by a commercial laboratory
and involves oven drying, coarse crushing then total grinding to a size of 90% passing 75µm.
All subsampling activities are carried out by commercial laboratory and are considered to be satisfactory.
Black Cat’s RC field duplicate samples are carried out at a rate of 1:50 and are sampled directly from the on-board
splitter on the rig. These are submitted for the same assay process as the original samples and the laboratory are
unaware of such submissions.
Sample sizes of 3kg are considered to be appropriate given the grain size (90% passing 75µm) of the material
sampled.
Samples are analysed by an external laboratory using a 40g fire assay with AAS finish. This method is considered
suitable for determining gold concentrations in rock and is a total digest method.
None used.

Recent drilling adhered to strict QAQC protocols involving weighing of samples, collection of field duplicates and
insertion of certified reference material (blanks and standards). QAQC data are checked against reference limits in
the SQL database on import.
The laboratory performs a number of internal processes including repeats, standards and blanks. Analysis of this
data displayed acceptable precision and accuracy.
Black Cat’s significant intercepts are verified by database, geological and corporate staff.
Black Cat will use twinned holes to assist in verification of historic results from time to time.
All primary data related to logging and sampling is directly entered to Excel templates. All data is sent to Perth and
stored in the centralised Access database with an SQL backend, managed by a database consultant.
No adjustments or calibrations are made to any assay data, apart from resetting below detection values to half
positive detection. First gold assay is utilised for exploration work.
All RC holes have been picked up using a licensed surveyor using RTK-GPS.
Down hole surveys are collected a north seeking gyro.

The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques
and data.

No compositing has been applied.
All holes except the 20MYRC034,035,036,037 were drilled towards grid east at -60 to intersect the mineralised
zones at a close to perpendicular relationship for the bulk of the deposits. Holes 20MYRC034,035,036,037 were
drilled to grid north to test the extents of an east-west trending mineralised structure.
All drilling from surface has been drilled as close to perpendicular to the predicted orientation of stratigraphy as
possible. This has reduced the risk of introducing a sampling bias as far as possible. No orientation-based
sampling bias has been identified in the data at this point.
Black Cat’s samples prepared on site by Black Cat geological staff. Samples are selected, collected into tied calico
bags and delivered to the laboratory by staff or contractors directly and there are no concerns with sample security.
Black Cat has recently created appropriate sampling procedures.

There has been extensive mining and exploration carried out in the area since gold was discovered in 1893.
Between the closure of the Queen Margaret Mine (~1913) and 1970 very little occurred with only three diamond
holes drilled in the area by Paringa in the 1940s. Activities in the 1970s and 1980s mainly focused on assessment
of old workings along the Queen Margaret‐Melbourne line. Queen Margaret NL, which floated in 1980 and was
subsequently taken over by Spargos Mining NL (“Spargos”), drilled a number of diamond and RC holes into the
main lode, with a view to reopening the historic Queen Margaret Mine. Geology, assays and collar files are
recorded, but the core is no longer available. Spargos farmed out to Mount Monger Gold Project (“MMGP”) (a Joint
Venture of General Gold and Ramsgate Resources) who drilled a further 165 RC holes into the Queen Margaret
system. No resources were publicly identified. Queen Margaret was never reopened, and attention turned to wider
exploration in the Bulong area.
Boundary was reputedly discovered by MMGP in 1991 by a BLEG program. About 73 RC holes have been drilled
into the Boundary deposit, initially by General Gold in 1992, then Acacia Resources in 1996, and Yilgarn Gold in
the early 2000s.
General Gold completed Aircore drilling over the immediate area of Myhree in 1992. RAB drilling extending this
line and on additional lines further north were completed by Acacia Resources in 1999. Four shallow RC holes
(TE1-TE4) were drilled by Bulong Mining to follow up anomalous results in the Aircore drilling and no further
exploration is recorded.
There has been no prior diamond drilling at either prospect.
The Greater Woodline area has been explored mostly by soil and wide spaced AC drilling by Cyprus and
subsequently Acacia and Anglo Gold. Anomaly 38 had RC drilling conducted by Acacia and Anglo along with 2
diamond holes that failed to hit mineralisation.
Around 1996 Acacia Resources sought to consolidate, by way of farm‐in and acquisition, much of the land holdings
in Bulong Belt. Acacia was the manager of New Bulong Joint Venture, and Queen Margaret Joint Venture. Acacia
was taken over by Anglo Gold who undertook much more soil geochemistry and did systematic transect drilling
across known prospects and into greenfield areas. Anglo consolidated the soil and drill‐hole datasets. After the
identification of a string of gold deposits which did not meet their corporate objective of plus‐million-ounce target,
Anglo tendered out their rights to the tenements and the database to ASX listed Yilgarn Gold in 2002.
Yilgarn Gold’s strategic objective was to develop high‐grade, narrow‐vein underground mining opportunities. It
further consolidated its land holding by acquiring properties of Central Kalgoorlie Gold Mines. In 2005 Yilgarn Gold
completely changed its corporate focus to off‐shore energy, disposed of its mineral assets, and changed its name
to Kairiki Energy.

Commentary
A local prospecting syndicate Bulong Mining Pty Ltd (“BMPL”) secured an option in 2009 and in 2012 fully acquired
the properties and the database. BMPL undertook serious metal detecting and limited RAB/RC drilling until early
2018 when the tenements were acquired by Black Cat.
The Bulong Project is located in the Gindalbie Domain of the Kurnalpi Terrane of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton.
Project-scale geology consists of granite-greenstone lithologies that were metamorphosed to greenschist facies
grade. The Archaean lithologies are cut by Proterozoic dolerite dykes.
The style of mineralisation is Archaean orogenic gold.

A summary of all information material to the understanding
of the exploration results including a tabulation of the
following information for all Material drill holes:
−

easting and northing of the drill hole collar;

−

elevation or Reduced Level (“RL”) (elevation above sea
level in metres) of the drill hole collar;

−

dip and azimuth of the hole;

−

down hole length and interception depth;

−

hole length; and

−

if the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis
that the information is not Material and this exclusion
does not detract from the understanding of the report, the
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the
case.

Locally the prospects are situated within a sediment and porphyry sequence between ultramafic units.
Tables containing drill hole collar, survey and intersection data are included in the body of the announcement.

In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg
cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually
Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and
some typical examples of such aggregations should be
shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.

All aggregated zones are length weighted.

These relationships are particularly important in the reporting
of Exploration Results.

All intercepts are reported as downhole depths as true widths are not yet determined.

No high grade cuts have been used.
All intersections are calculated using a 1 g/t Au lower cut-off with maximum waste zones between grades of 1m,
except where stated in the body of the report.

Not applicable, as no metal equivalent values have been reported.

Commentary

If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg
‘down hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations
of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery
being reported These should include, but not be limited to a
plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate
sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration.
Results are not practicable, representative reporting of both
low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious
or contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for
lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale stepout drilling).

Appropriate diagrams have been included in the body of the announcement.

All results have been tabulated in this release.

Geophysical surveys including aeromagnetic surveys have been carried out by previous owners to highlight and
interpret prospective structures in the project area.
SAM surveys have been conducted by GAP Geophysics on 50m spaced lines, oriented 090-270 degrees. SAM
data was interpreted by Southern Geoscience. Targets are based on interpreted zones of lithological and structural
complexity from magnetometric conductivity, relative magnetic intensity and electromagnetic conductivity layers.
Black Cat is continuing an exploration program which will target extension of mineralisation at. Myhree, Trump,
Boundary and regional targets.
