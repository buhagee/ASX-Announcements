Projects Overview
Adelong Goldfield
Historically the Adelong goldfield has produced around 800k ozs of gold. Many of the hard rock
mines recorded very high grades averaging in excess of one ounce of gold per ton of ore.

Ability To Produce Gold Onsite

past operation.
 Currently the plant is designed to produce a gravity concentrate

reconfiguring to operate efficiently. 3D Resources plans to review
these studies as well as alternate options for processing the ores
before investing in re-opening the mine

3D Resources plans to undertake a re- assessment of the development options. This will
include:
• Short term options to process mullock not suitable for the onsite plant externally
• Upgrading the existing Adelong plant.
• Review contract mining options for developing Challenger and Currajong as open cut
operations (or possibly underground)
• Increase throughput capacity and production rates
• Expanding resources
• Initiating a regional exploration program

Adelong Goldfield– Overview

For personal use only

Historical High-Grade Production of Around 800k ozs








Adelong Goldfield forms part of a much larger
structural feature known as the Gilmore Suture. This
major fault zone can be traced for several hundred
kilometres and is associated with a number of
significant gold deposits over at least 200km of this
structure.
In the Adelong Goldfield the shear zone bifurcates
with a western fault following the Adelong Creek
(west of the gold deposits) and with main structure
to the east of the main mines.
Gold mineralisation occurs in a series of sub-parallel
faults that can be traced through the Wondalga
Granodiorite for more than 4km north of Adelong.
Historically the Adelong goldfield has produced
around 800k ozs of gold from within the company’s
licenses. Many of the hard rock mines recorded very
high grades averaging in excess of one ounce of gold
per ton of ore.

Challenger Gold Project

For personal use only

Near Term Development Option
Two separate parallel veins were mined in the past with average grades



mined estimated to be 87g/t Au (2.8oz of gold per ton). Between these two
shear hosted veins is a breccia zone that is up to 15metres wide that
represents resources to be mined at Challenger. The veins continue to depth
and so there would be scope for high grade ores at depth. Challenger
Extended is the northern extension to the deposit that is largely unexplored
at depth.
Currently the decline has provided access to a level approximately 80m



below surface as shown on this section.
The high-grade veins continue to depth and will require access via a decline.

Currajong Gold Project

For personal use only

Large Scale Open Cut Potential
The Currajong Mine has largely worked the “Main reef” but drilling and records show that there are a series of vein



deposits with the main vein up to 17m wide and formed by brecciated silicified rock
Some pockets of very high grade ores were mined and the overall historical production is modest with only 8,000oz



having been produced.
While much of the historic mining was via shafts to about 100m, an adit level development was driven 250m in from



Adelong Creek that gives access to Currajong at around 150m below surface
The larger lower grade mineralisation makes this an attractive target for open cut mining but there is also potential for



lower cost underground mining from the adit level.

For personal use only

Exploration for Additional Inferred Resources1
With some additional drilling 3D Resources also believes that it can quickly generate additional Inferred
Resources for Donkey Hill, Gibraltar, Sawpit and some of the parallel structures to Currajong that are currently
excluded from the resource estimates.
Donkey Hill



o

Five parallel vein systems identified with 3 showing potential. Drilling to be undertaken

o

Recorded production since 1889 was approximately 10,000 oz at an average grade of 1.3 oz/t {41
g/t), with actual production probably much higher.

Gibraltar





A complex of reefs with a distinct NE trend contrasting strongly with the N trend of most of the
rest of the goldfield. Old mine plans exist and digitisation of that data should aid geological
interpretation and future exploration.

Sawpit



o

Historical reports indicate that both narrow high-grade quartz veins and lower grade disseminated
mineralisation was mined at certain locations along this trend.

o

Specific reports on the Sawpit area record the presence of lodes from 1 to 6 m wide assaying up
to 60 g/t.
