81% Increase in Greenfields Mineral Resources
Underpins Coolgardie PFS Update
Highlights:
• Overhaul of Greenfields open pit resource model delivers an 81%
increase in Mineral Resource;
• Underpins Focus’ decision to update Coolgardie Gold Project PFS;
• Clear pathway for fast-tracked return by Focus to gold production;
• Part of strategy to fund flagship Laverton Gold Project
West Australian gold explorer Focus Minerals (ASX: FML) (Focus or the Company) is pleased to
announce the new JORC 2012 Minerals Resource for the Greenfields gold deposit (Greenfields), as
a result of a comprehensive review of the historical resource model that was used in the 2017 Prefeasibility Study (2017 PFS).1
Greenfields is part of Focus’ Coolgardie Gold Project (Coolgardie), which covers 175km2 of highly
prospective tenements on the outskirts of the Coolgardie township in the Goldfields.
The new JORC 2012 open pit resource model for Greenfields is reported above 230mRL (to 170m
below surface) using a 0.8g/t Au cut-off grade and comprises:

Focus is currently updating the 2017 PFS with the new Greenfields resource model and a much more
favourable gold price. The updated PFS could pave the way for a return to mining at Coolgardie,
which would add significant value for the Company’s shareholders as well as generate funding for our
flagship development opportunity, the 100%-owned Laverton Gold Project.
Commenting, Focus Minerals’ CEO, Mr Zhaoya Wang, said:
“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to commend the team for the diligent work in reexamining historical data of Greenfields. We look forward to what the new PFS could bring to
Coolgardie.

At the same time, Focus is continuing its exploration efforts at our 100%-owned Laverton Gold
Project. In line with our stated commitments, the Laverton PFS study will be completed by December
2020.”
The Greenfields Ore Reserve in the 2017 PFS should not be relied upon as it was built on the
previous resource model. The updated PFS will be completed in early August, which will provide the
updated ore reserve numbers.

Greenfields Open Pit Gold Deposit
Revised approach to deal with historic misunderstanding
The Greenfields Open Pit (OP) Gold Deposit is located 3.8km north-east of the Coolgardie township
and 400m east of Focus’ Three Mile Hill processing plant (Figure 1).

Greenfields was mined by Focus for a short period in 2013. However, mining indicated major
reconciliation variance between resource and mined/milled production. The resource was re-blocked
to assist mining and an external consultant was engaged. The consultant’s update identified two
orientations of mineralisation at Greenfields, comprising a stacked moderate dip set and a steeper set
near the dolerite-black flag volcanic contact. This mineralised geology had not been reflected in the
March 2012 resource model, which confined the majority of the mineralisation to a steep lode
(average 75/198 dip/dip direction) located adjacent and hanging wall to the dolerite-black flag
volcanic contact (Figure 2).

Figure 2: March 2012 Resource Block Model - which was used in the 2017 PFS (red dashed line: 2017 PFS pit
design)

In July 2013, mining at Coolgardie – and therefore Greenfields – was suspended because of poor
production performance and high costs.
In May 2017, the Greenfields OP Mineral Resource was updated to JORC 2012 format for use in a
Coolgardie PFS. The depleted JORC 2012 Greenfields OP resource, as announced to the ASX on 29
May 2017, comprised:

However, the updated Mineral Resource did not factor in the two orientations of mineralisation at
Greenfields. In addition, based on a then-relevant Australian dollar gold price of $1,580/oz, the

For personal use only

Coolgardie PFS ascribed a probable reserve to Greenfields of only 1,016Kt @ 1.45g/t Au for
47,100oz and a net value of $3 million.
The 2017 PFS outcomes, particularly in relation to Greenfields, were not considered sufficient for
immediate follow-up and operational attention. This prompted Focus to prioritise its attention on the
Laverton Gold Project as other commercialisation options for Coolgardie, including a divestment of
the project, were considered.
In June 2020, Focus commissioned Mining One to update the 2017 Coolgardie PFS using a revised
Australian gold price of $2,200/oz. During the initial stage of data handover, the Greenfields model
was reviewed in-house by the Focus exploration team (which was not employed by the Company in
2013) and the discrepancy in modelled orientation noted. This led to Focus announcing today an 81%
increase in Greenfields OP Mineral Resource, as reported above 230mRL (to 170m below surface)
using a 0.8g/t Au cut-off grade, and comprising:

Total Mineral Resource

The Greenfields OP Mineral Resource is reported on a dry tonnage basis. The measured component
of this resource has been subject to grade-control drilling to approximately ~7-10m spacing and falls
within the OP shell as designed by Coolgardie’s 2017 PFS. In total, 146 RC grade-control holes were
drilled at Greenfields in 2013 for 5,847m. These holes and pit observations by an external mining
consultant during 2013 provided the additional information required to comprehensively remodel the
Greenfields OP resource.

The new model is supported by dense grade control drilling and has comprehensively delineated two
orientations of mineralisation at Greenfields. The primary mineralised orientation comprises four
stacked steep lodes (Domains 8-11 with average 54/190 dip/dip direction). These lodes terminate at
the footwall dolerite-black flag volcanic contact (contact has average orientation of 75/201 dip/dip
direction) in the northern part of the OP. The steep lodes are in general mostly greater than 4m thick
and average 8-10m width. This orientation differs significantly from the 2012 resource where the
majority of steep mineralisation was modelled on the hanging wall and sub-parallel to the
dolerite- black flag volcanic contact. Furthermore, top cuts have been adjusted aided by high density
drilling that improved variography.

The secondary orientation comprises a set of 24 stacked moderate dip structures (domains 1-7 and
12-29) with average orientation of 28/190 (dip/dip direction). These moderate dip structures average
around 2m thickness with around 30-40% hosting mineralisation of 4m or more in thickness. The
moderate dip mineralisation significantly extends to the SSW from its northern termination at the
dolerite-black flag volcanic contact. The moderate dip lodes significantly broaden the width of
mineralisation at Greenfields.
There are two mineral shoot plunges recognised in the 2020 Greenfields resource model. Predictably,
the intersection of the moderate and steep structural sets forms a shallow ESE plunging shoot. In
addition, the steeper lodes host a moderate SE-plunging shoot that generally is in parallel to the
intersection of the steep shoots with the footwall dolerite-black flag volcanic contact.

Updated Coolgardie PFS

For personal use only

Driven by Greenfields resource update, higher sustainable gold price
Following the disappointing outcomes of the 2017 Coolgardie PFS, Focus commenced a process to
divest the Coolgardie project. Despite significant interest from third parties that validated Focus’
strategic move, the Company was unable to finalise a divestment because of its inability to secure
necessary approvals in a timely manner.
At the start of 2020, Focus decided to pursue other value-adding options for Coolgardie, including an
investigation into the feasibility of a resumption of mining at Coolgardie. A decision was made to
revisit the 2017 PFS in the context of the significantly higher external gold price environment. As
explained earlier, during the data handover process to Mining One, Focus’ exploration team
reassessed Greenfields’ gold potential based on a proper evaluation of the modelled orientation of the
open pit mineralisation. This resulted in the significant open pit Mineral Resource upgrade for
Greenfields and will play an important role in the PFS assessment of the potential viability of returning
Coolgardie to production.
The Laverton Gold Project remains Focus’ core and most valuable development option. However, the
significant rebasing of the gold price since 2017 means that Coolgardie could become a significant
cash producer for Focus in the short to medium term, assist in providing funding for Laverton’s mine
development and leave the Company as a multi-asset gold producer.
The Coolgardie PFS is expected to be completed by early August.

Focus Minerals Ltd (FML) RC samples were sampled on one metre intervals via a
riffle splitter.
At the assay laboratory, all samples were oven dried, crushed to a nominal 10mm
using a jaw crusher (core samples only) and weighed. Samples in excess of 3kg in
weight were riffle split to achieve a maximum 3kg sample weight before being
pulverized to 90% passing 75μm. The samples were then prepared for fire assay.
Historic RC holes have been sampled on 1m or as a 2m composite. It is unsure how
the composite sampling for pre-Focus drilling would have been undertaken.
For diamond core, sample intervals are either cut on metre intervals or with intervals
selected to geological boundaries down to 10cm. Core is cut in half by diamond
bladed saw with half sent to the laboratory and half retained in the core tray on site.
Some of the diamond core has been ¼ core sampled, this is only in the minority of
cases.
Drilling included in the resource estimate include RC face sampling hammer or NQ
size diamond core. All FML drill core was orientated by the drilling contractor using
an Ezy-mark system. Most holes were surveyed upon completion of the drilling have
either been surveyed by single-shot camera, electronic multi-shot (EMS) or
Gyroscopic methods.
In recent FML drilling all RC samples are drilled dry wherever possible to maximize
recovery, with water injected on the outside return to minimize dust. There have been
no recovery or sample quality issues for the FML drilling RC chips or drill core.
Sample recovery have been recorded in the drill hole logs for the diamond holes
drilled by CGNL with no recovery issues. Historic RC drilling recovery is not
recorded.
FML drill holes were logged for the entire length of the hole.
All diamond core samples were orientated, marked into metre intervals and
compared to the depth measurements on the core blocks. Any core loss was noted
and recorded in the database. All core was logged for structure and geology using
the same system as RC. The core was photographed wet and dry one tray at a time
using a standardised photography jig.
All RC samples were geologically logged to record weathering, regolith, rock type,
colour, alteration, mineralisation, structure and texture and any other notable features
that are present.
Logging was qualitative; however, the geologists often record quantitative mineral
percentage ranges.
Original drill logs have been viewed and used to validate data stored in acQuire for a
majority of the pre-Focus drilling.
FML diamond core samples were taken from half core or quarter core cut using an
Almonte automatic core saw. The remainder of the core was retained in core trays.
RC samples were cone split to a nominal 2.5kg to 3kg sample weight. The drilling
method was designed to maximise sample recovery and delivery of a clean,
representative sample into the calico bag.
The samples were collected in a pre-numbered calico bag bearing a unique sample
ID. Samples were crushed to 75μm at the laboratory and riffle split (if required) to a
maximum 3kg sample weight.
Analytical methods for gold analysis for much of the historical drilling are 40g Fire
Assay method and 50g Aqua Regia completed at various laboratories in Kalgoorlie
and Perth. FML samples have been assayed by ALS Chemex in Kalgoorlie or Perth
using a 30g Fire Assay method with an AAS finish.

The assay laboratories’ sample preparation procedures follow industry best practice,
with techniques and practices that are appropriate for this style of mineralisation. Pulp
duplicates were taken at the pulverising stage and selective repeats conducted at the
laboratories’ discretion.
Drilling completed by Focus is subject to rigorous quality control processes in the
sampling process. Routine standards and “blanks” are inserted into the sample
strings and monitored on return from the laboratory. Any failures by these control
samples to be within the acceptable three standard deviation limits above and below
the certified values results in a string of samples around the failed sample to be retested by the laboratory.
Regular reviews of the sampling were carried out by the supervising geologist and
senior field staff, to ensure all procedures were followed and best industry practice
carried out.
The sample sizes were considered to be appropriate for the type, style and
consistency of mineralisation encountered during this phase of exploration.
The assay method and laboratory procedures were appropriate for this style of
mineralisation. The fire assay technique was designed to measure total gold in the
sample.
No geophysical tools, spectrometers or handheld XRF instruments were used.
The QA/QC process described above was sufficient to establish acceptable levels of
accuracy and precision. All results from assay standards and duplicates were
scrutinised to ensure they fell within acceptable tolerances.
Very little in the way of quality control data is available from sampling of the historical
drilling that currently defines the resource. Drilling by Focus aimed to confirm the
geometry of the ore envelope and grade tenor encountered in historical drilling.
Significant intervals were visually inspected by company geologists to correlate assay
results to logged mineralisation.
Primary data is sent in digital format to the company’s Database Administrator (DBA)
as often as was practicable. The DBA imports the data into an acQuire database,
with assay results merged into the database upon receipt from the laboratory. Once
loaded, data was extracted for verification by the geologist in charge of the project.
Historic holes were validated against paper copies and WAMEX reports where
possible.
No adjustments were made to any current or historic data. If data could not be
validated to a reasonable level of certainty it was not used in any resource
estimations.
All co-ordinates and bearings use the MGA94 Zone 51 grid system.
FML drill collars were surveyed by DGPS base station instruments.
Most of the RC and diamond holes have down hole surveys by
either Eastmann single shot camera, Electronic Multi-shot or Gyroscopic methods.
Historic hole collar survey methods are unknown although Gold Mines Coolgardie JV
states collars were surveyed by Company Survey.
Drilling has been conducted on 20m by 10 – 15m spaced grid on sections orientated
across strike of the ore zone at an azimuth of either 020ºor 200 ºand at various
dips.
After mining commenced FML conducted RC Grade control drilling on a 10m x 10m
staggered grid at different pit floor levels across the mineralisation, averaging 40m
depth. Wider spaced drilling exists at depth up to as wide as 40m by 80m.
Drilling was designed based on known geological models, field mapping, verified
historical data and cross-sectional interpretation.
Drill holes were orientated at right angles to the strike of the deposit, with dip
optimised for drill capabilities and dip of the mineralisation.

Greenfields is located within Mining Lease M15/154, registered to Focus Minerals Ltd.
and Focus Operations Pty Ltd of Perth, Western Australia and which is current until
April 2027.
There are no current registered Native Title claims over the Coolgardie project areas.
Greenfields is a site of numerous historic workings including small pits and shafts.
However, no production figures are available for these workings.
Modern exploration by Coolgardie Gold NL include trenching and multiple drill
campaigns including RAB, RC and Diamond drilling.
Gold Mines of Coolgardie Pty Ltd (GMC), MPI Gold Pty Ltd and FML have also run
drilling campaigns of RC and Diamond at Greenfields.
Focus Minerals mined the deposit by open pit extraction until July 2013.
The Greenfields deposit is located within the Greenfield dolerite sill within the
Coolgardie Greenstone Belt.
There are three rock types present in the pit; dolerite (south wall), felsic volcaniclastics
(footwall to mineralisation) and ultramafics (North Wall). The mineralisation at
Greenfields forms a conjugate set of steep and moderate dipping lodes.
Mineralisation is hosted by a quartz vein stockwork that exploits a conjugate set of
brittle-ductile fractures. Bucky quartz veins have accessory pyrrhotite and
arsenopyrite sulphides and sometimes visible gold is observed. Veins display crack
seal textures and are commonly weakly wall rock laminated.
The wall rock to the veins is commonly bleached over 0.2 - 0-.4m intervals.

Mineralised intersections are reported at a 0.5g/t Au cut-off with a minimum reporting
width of 1m for RC holes and 0.2m for diamond holes, composited to 1m.

Relationship between
mineralisation widths and
intercept lengths

•

Holes were drilled orthogonal to mineralisation as much as possible, however the exact
relationship between intercept width and true width cannot be estimated exactly in all
cases.

Data was geologically logged electronically; collar and downhole surveys were also
received electronically as was the laboratory analysis results. These electronic files
were loaded into an acQuire database by either consultants rOREdata or the
company in-house Database Administrator. Data was routinely extracted to Microsoft
Access during the drilling program for validation by the geologist in charge of the
project.
FML’s database is a Microsoft SQL Server database (acQuire), which is case
sensitive, relational, and normalised to the Third Normal Form. As a result of
normalisation, the following data integrity categories exist:
o Entity Integrity: no duplicate rows in a table, eliminated redundancy and
chance of error.
o Domain Integrity: Enforces valid entries for a given column by
restricting the type, the format, or a range of values.
o Referential Integrity: Rows cannot be deleted which are used by other
records.
o User-Defined Integrity: business rules enforced by acQuire and
validation codes set up by FML.
Additionally, in-house validation scripts are routinely run in acQuire on FML’s
database and they include the following checks:
o Missing collar information
o Missing logging, sampling, downhole survey data and hole diameter
o Overlapping intervals in geological logging, sampling, down hole
surveys
o Checks for character data in numeric fields
The historical Greenfields drill data was validated by the Focus data management
team and the Project Geologist. This involved collaborating all collar, downhole
survey, geology and assay data with existing hardcopy material as well as displaying
the holes in three dimensions in Surpac to determine any unusual or unlikely trends
in the data so that it could be rectified before loading into the Focus site
database. This process was thorough and took a couple of months for the team to
complete.
Alex Aaltonen, the Competent Person for Sections 1 and 2 of Table 1 is FML’s
General Manager - Exploration and conducts regular site visits.
Hannah Kosovich, the Competent Person for Section 3 of Table 1 is FML’s
Resource Geologist and last visited site in February 2014.
All available drill hole, mining data and pit mapping was used to guide the geological
interpretation of the mineralisation.
The mineralised geological interpretation was generated in Seequent Leapfrog Geo
implicit modelling software.
A total of 29 lodes were modelled. Four larger, steeper dipping (55 o to SSW) lodes
were modelled, along with 25 less continuous, shallower dipping (~28 o to SSW)
lodes. The shallower lodes intersect the steeper lodes near surface with “soft
boundaries” meaning drill holes intersecting both mineralised lodes were shared in

the estimation process. However, blocks in the final model were coded with the flat
lying mineralised domain estimation values and associated lode codes.
Minor deviation of the lode geometry was modelled between drill holes down dip and
along strike.
The resource extends over a NW strike length of over 480m and includes the ~150m
interval from the base of the final mined surface down to the 150mRL, some 250m
below surface.
The thickness of the four steeper lodes varies from average thickness of 20m near
surface pinching to an average thickness of 3m at depth. The flatter lying lodes vary
from 1m to 8m wide have an average thickness of 3m.
Samples within the wireframes were composited to even 1m intervals, the dominant
sample interval from historic drilling. Residual samples that did not meet the
minimum length criteria (less than 0.2m) of the compositing process were appended
to the adjacent sample so that all material within the wireframe was included.
Composited assay values of each domain were exported to a text file (.csv) and
imported into Snowden Supervisor for geostatistical analysis.
A review of histograms, probability plots and mean/variance plots for
the individual lodes revealed outlier sample values in some of the ldoes. A maximum
top-cut of 15g/t Au and an average of 10g/t Au was used for the different lodes, with
assays above the top-cut set to the top-cut value.
Variograms were modelled in Supervisor for the four steeper lodes and one of
the flat lying lodes that had the largest number of samples. Other flay lying lodes
shared this variogram.
GEOVIA Surpac Software was used for the estimation and modelling process. The
model was created in GDA 94 grid co-ordinates. Block sizes for the model were 5m
in Y, 10m in X and 5m in Z direction. Sub celling of the parent blocks was permitted
to 1.25m in the Y direction, 2.5m in the X direction and 1.25m in the Z direction. Subblocking was used to best fill the wireframes and inherit the grade of the parent
block. No rotation was applied to the orientation of the blocks.
Minimum (8) and maximum (20) sample numbers were selected based on a Kriging
Neighbourhood analysis in Supervisor.
An elliptical search was used orientated on the lode geometry and based on range of
the Variograms.
Three search passes were run in order to fill the block model with estimated Au
values. After each search pass the search range was increased and the minimum
number of samples was decreased.
The estimate was validated by a number of methods. An initial visual review was
done by comparing estimated blocks and raw drill holes.
Tonnage weighted mean grades were compared for all lodes with the raw and topcapped drill hole values. There were no major differences.
Swath plots of drill hole values and estimated Au grades were generated in
Supervisor software and showed the estimated grades honoured the trend of the
drilling data.

GMC who mined Greenfields from Dec 2003 to Jan 2005 had an overall
reconciliation of ~96.9% of tonnes, 100.7% of grade and 101% of ounces milled
compared to mined.
Greenfields deposit occurs in an area of previous disturbance with an open cut pit
and associated waste dump.
The Three Mile Hill Processing Plant is currently on care and maintenance, but has
all the necessary tailing facilities etc, that would allow for a restart of the plant.
Bulk density test work was carried out on diamond core samples using a water
immersion method for these determinations.
Average bulk densities were applied to modelled weathering profiles.
Bulk densities of 2.07, 2.43 and 2.87 t/m³were applied to Oxide, Transitional and
Fresh resources respectively.

Resources have been classified as either Measured or Indicated based mainly on
geological confidence in the geometry and continuity of the lodes. In addition,
various estimation output parameters such as number of samples, search pass,
kriging variance, and slope of regression have been used to assist in classification.
Measured resources have been reported inside the 2013 Pre-Feasibility Study pit
design optimisation.
Indicated resources have been reported above the 230mRL given the close drill
spacing and reasonable prospects for economic extraction.

No external audits of the mineral resource have been conducted.
The mineral resource relates to global tonnage and grade estimates.
The Greenfields Pit has been mined in 4 campaigns in the modern era commencing
in 1986 and finishing in 2005 producing some 0.98Mt @ 1.81g/t for 56,776 ounces
(reconciled).
