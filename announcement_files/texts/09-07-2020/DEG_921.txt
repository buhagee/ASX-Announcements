High gold recoveries achieved at Hemi

Excellent metallurgy results from initial testing at Brolga

Highlights:


Initial metallurgical testwork on Brolga mineralisation has achieved excellent gold recoveries:
−

Oxide 93.0 % based on CIL leach

−

Fresh 96.3 % based on sulphide flotation, oxidation and CIL leach



The testwork flowsheet comprised a conventional carbon in leach (CIL) circuit to treat oxide
mineralisation. An industry accepted circuit comprising sulphide flotation to generate a concentrate
prior to oxidation was used to treat fresh mineralisation.



The flotation circuit generated a gold-rich sulphide concentrate that was oxidised using pressure
oxidation (POX). The concentrate represented approximately 10% of the ore feed to the flotation
circuit. That is, approximately 10% mass pull. Oxidised flotation concentrate from the POX circuit was
treated by CIL to recover gold. Other methods of oxidation will also be assessed during ongoing test
work.



POX is an established treatment process used worldwide on large scale gold deposits such as Hemi.
Examples of operations that are currently using a POX circuit include: Macraes, Porgera and Lihir in
the Asia Pacific region, various Carlin deposits in the USA and Alacer Gold’s Copler Mine in Turkey.



Additional samples from Brolga and Aquila covering oxide, transitional and fresh mineralisation will be
tested to assess variability and to optimise the flowsheet.



Previous testwork conducted on other regional resources (2.2Moz) outside Hemi indicates that the
Hemi testwork flowsheet would be suitable to treat those deposits.



Additional metallurgical testwork results are expected later in the current September quarter.

De Grey Mining Managing Director, Glenn Jardine commented:
“The gold recovery achieved in the initial metallurgical testwork of oxide, transition and fresh mineralisation
at Brolga is very encouraging. The testwork significantly de-risks the potential development of Hemi as a
Tier 1 gold project in a Tier 1 jurisdiction. The testwork flowsheet used for Hemi can also be applied to De
Grey’s other regional resources in the Mallina Basin.
Hemi is a growing resource and contains a combination of oxide, transitional and fresh sulphide
mineralisation. We will continue to increase our understanding of the scale and metallurgical properties
of each of these domains across the deposit with ongoing testwork.
Hemi’s excellent location, along a major transport, gas and power corridors, all within 60km of Port
Hedland, is a major advantage for a Tier 1 gold resource and development project.”

De Grey Mining Limited (ASX: DEG, “De Grey” or the “Company”) is pleased to report positive results from
initial metallurgical testwork from the Hemi gold deposit, located approximately 60km south of Port Hedland
in Western Australia.

For personal use only

The initial metallurgical testwork was conducted by ALS Metallurgy, a leading global testing and analysis
company, under the supervision of GR Engineering Services Limited (GRES) and with input from De
Grey’s technical team.

Hemi Metallurgy Testwork Program

Comprehensive testwork is currently in progress on composites obtained from two diamond drill holes
(HEDD001 and HERC011D) at Brolga. Three of the composite samples contain fresh mineralisation and
another composite comprises transitional mineralisation. Composite 4, comprising fresh mineralization,
has completed a full suite of testwork including crushing, grinding (150μm to 53μm), multi-element
analysis, gravity separation, whole of ore cyanide leaching and CIL treatment, sulphide flotation, oxidation
and cyanide leaching of oxidised flotation concentrate and cyanide leaching of flotation tailings.

An additional six dedicated larger diameter (PQ and HQ) diamond core holes (HEDD004 - HEDD009)
have been completed to provide larger volume samples within the oxide, transition and fresh domains
throughout the deposit. These holes have been drilled and are currently being sampled and transported
to ALS Metallurgy in Perth and will provide a detailed assessment of metallurgical variability across the
deposit. Detailed results of this comprehensive program are expected later this current September quarter.
Drill hole locations and sample intervals of the composites are provided in Table 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4.

Oxide Mineralisation – Brolga

Twelve samples of oxide mineralisation were taken from two RC holes (HERC034 and HERC035) drilled
at Brolga. Each sample was separately tested using conventional CIL testwork by a 24 hour bottle roll
cyanide extraction method. The samples selected covered a range of mineralisation styles including
sediments, mafic intrusive and intermediate intrusive. Head grades varied between 0.1 g/t Au and 4.1 g/t
Au. The average grade of all samples was 1.5 g/t Au. Metallurgical recovery of gold varied between 85%
and 98% at an average metallurgy recovery of 93% as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Simplified testwork flowsheet for oxide ore (note: numbers subject to rounding)

Fresh Mineralisation – Brolga
Composite 4 comprised fresh mineralisation taken from across two diamond drill holes HEDD001 and
HERC011D at Brolga. The testwork on composite 4 comprised sulphide flotation of a gold-rich concentrate
followed by pressure oxidation of the concentrate which is then subjected to conventional CIL to recover
gold. In addition, to increase the overall gold recovery, the tailings from sulphide flotation were also
subjected to CIL to recover gold not included in the flotation concentrate.
Overall gold recovery of 96.3% was achieved on the composite 4 sample with the sample flowsheet
including pressure oxidation shown in Figure 2.
Composite 4 was assessed at a grind size of p80 of 75μm. Flotation testwork was also conducted using
a single stage of flotation. The mass pull from the composite to concentrate was approximately 10%.

Flotation testwork to optimise grind size, concentrate grade, mass pull and overall gold recovery is
continuing. The assayed head grade of composite 4 was 2.62 g/t Au. It should be noted that the head
grade of composite 4 may not represent the overall average grade of the Brolga or Hemi deposits. For
example, lower head grades can result in lower overall recoveries. However, the low tail grade achieved
in the testwork conducted on composite 4 was very encouraging for achieving high recoveries at lower
head grades.
The four composite samples were selected for initial metallurgical testwork as they contained similar levels
of sulphide mineralisation. Composite 1 is partially oxidised and forms part of the transition zone.
Composite 4 was selected for the initial assessment due to the largest volume of sample material. All four
samples consistently contain high sulphide content of both arsenopyrite and pyrite.
Composites 1 through 3 were tested using flotation and CIL using the same flowsheet as shown in Figure
2 with the results of pressure oxidation pending.
Metallurgical recoveries for these three composites prior to treatment through POX compared with
Composite 4, also prior to treatment through POX, are shown in Table 1. A recovery of 99% was achieved
through POX treatment for Composite 4 and overall recoveries for Composites 1 to 3 are also expected to
be high after POX treatment.

The transition sample, composite 1, produced a lower flotation recovery relative to composites 2 to 4,
which comprise fresh mineralisation. However, after the flotation tailing was treated using CIL, the overall
recovery for composite 1 was greater than 95%. This is a very encouraging result for transition
mineralisation and given the head grade of composite 1 was 1.4 g/t Au.
As previously discussed, testwork and optimisation of each stage of processing is ongoing. Further
testwork will include optimising the grind size, flotation grade, mass pull, flotation recovery and flotation
tail recovery.

Background

For personal use only

Hemi is a new major gold discovery with world class infrastructure at its doorstep. Gold mineralisation at
Hemi is hosted in a series of intrusions associated with stringer and disseminated sulphide rich zones.
This style of mineralisation is new to the Pilbara region and shows a scale of mineralisation not previously
seen in the Mallina Basin.

There are at least four other look-alike intrusion targets already identified the immediate vicinity of Hemi Scooby, Shaggy, Antwerp and Alectroenas. Three already host known shallow gold mineralisation with
Alectroenas never previously drilled.
A detailed aeromagnetic over the Scooby to Antwerp trend has recently been completed. The results are
being analysed to identify potential new intrusive targets.

• Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut
channels, random chips, or specific
specialised
industry
standard
measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down
hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF
instruments, etc.). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning
of sampling.

• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has
been done this would be relatively simple
(e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to
obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire
assay’). In other cases, more explanation
may be required, such as where there is
coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems.

mineralisation types (e.g. submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.
• Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation,
open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger,
Bangka, sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core
diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of

type, whether core is oriented and if so, by
what method, etc.).
• Method of recording and assessing core
and chip sample recoveries and results
assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample
recovery and ensure representative nature
of the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between
sample recovery and grade and whether
sample bias may have occurred due to
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse
material.
• Whether core and chip samples have been
geologically and geotechnically logged to a
level of detail to support appropriate Mineral

aggregation should be stated and some
typical examples of such aggregations
should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting
of metal equivalent values should be
clearly stated.

Relationship
between
mineralisation
widths
and
intercept
lengths

• These relationships are particularly
important in the reporting of Exploration
Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation
with respect to the drill hole angle is
known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole
lengths are reported, there should be a
clear statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down
hole length, true width not known’).

•

Diagrams

• Appropriate maps and sections (with
scales) and tabulations of intercepts
should be included for any significant
discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and
appropriate sectional views.

•

Data and plans are provided in the report.

Balanced
reporting

• Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and
high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting
of Exploration Results.

•

The report is considered balanced and provided in
context.
Further metallurgical results are on-going with updated
results expected during the September quarter 2020.

Other
substantive
exploration
data

• Other exploration data, if meaningful
and material, should be reported
including (but not limited to): geological
observations;
geophysical
survey
results; geochemical survey results;
bulk samples – size and method of
treatment; metallurgical test results;
bulk
density,
groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics;
potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.

• The nature and scale of planned further
work (e.g. tests for lateral extensions or
depth extensions or large-scale stepout drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas
of possible extensions, including the
main geological interpretations and
future drilling areas, provided this
information is not commercially
sensitive.

The drill holes are interpreted to be approximately
perpendicular to the strike of mineralisation.
The drilling was completed to provide core in order to
define the mineralisation and is being used to carry out
determination of rock quality properties including
strength,
hardness,
recovery
and
sulphide
concentrations.

Previous metallurgical testwork has been completed on
the existing gold resources within the Mallina Gold
Project.
This new metallurgical data is only on the new Hemi
deposit which has recently been discovered by De Grey.
Results support the previous metallurgical data on the
other resources

Independent consultant engineers (GRES) are
evaluating the results to establish a preferred
processing plant, components, design including layout,
operating costs and capital requirements.
Further ongoing metallurgical test work is continuing
with an additional 6 dedicated diamond core holes with
processing and metallurgical testwork underway.
Additional sampling of the other deposits at Hemi is
currently underway.
