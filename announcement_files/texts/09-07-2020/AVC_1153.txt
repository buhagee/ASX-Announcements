Gophr achieves strong growth in revenue for 1st Half 2020 to ~£3m
This compares to Full Year 2019 revenue of £3.6m
Series A capital raise now scheduled for 2H20 – targeting a £3m-£5m investment
Data from over 1m deliveries now being used to build machine learning capabilities

Auctus Investment Group Limited (ASX: AVC) (‘AVC’, ‘Auctus’ or ‘the Company’) provides the following
update in relation to the performance of Gophr Limited (Gophr) following the June 2020 quarter.

Background:
Gophr is a leading same-day courier marketplace in the UK. The platform provides a wide range of
service capabilities utilising external couriers to optimise delivery solutions for customers. The
potential scalability of the business model puts Gophr in a prime position to tackle the UK same-day
delivery market estimated to be worth in-excess of £1.5bn per annum.
Auctus Investment Holdings (AIH) holds a direct 25% shareholding in Gophr post a restructure and
capital raise announced to the market May 2019. In addition, AIH holds a £800k Convertible Note and
Vendor Loans to the Founders totalling £1.169m. Auctus is currently re-negotiating the Convertible
Note, which is due to expire at the end of July.

Gophr Update:
Gophr has had a strong start to 2020, having reached approximately £3m in revenue (unaudited) for
the 6-month period ending June 2020. Additionally, Gophr has achieved a positive EBITDA for each of
April, May and June. Given revenues are traditionally skewed towards the second half (Christmas),
Gophr believe they are well positioned to grow revenue for 2020 to over £6m.
Since its inception, Gophr has completed over 1m “jobs”, gathering significant amounts of highly
granular data on each of those. Gophr is now taking the first steps into machine learning to further
optimise the platform’s operational performance.

Valuation:
Auctus currently holds its equity stake in Gophr on balance sheet at a multiple of less than 1 times
2019 revenue. This valuation (~£750k for AIH 25%) is based on independent third-party investment
during its capital raise in mid-2019.
As part of its strategic growth plan, Gophr management is building towards a Series A capital raise
over coming months. To date they have engaged with numerous potential strategic investors, along
with venture capital firms in the UK and received a positive response.
We look forward to keeping Auctus shareholders up to date on this process over coming months with
a view towards revaluing our investment at the completion of this process.
