ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
CELLMID SIGNS EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT FOR SARS-CoV-2 LABORATORY TESTS
SYDNEY, Thursday, 9 July 2020: Cellmid Limited (ASX: CDY) is pleased to advise that it
has
signed
an
exclusive
distribution
agreement
(“Agreement”)
with
Immunodiagnostics Limited, Hong Kong (IMD) for laboratory based, quantitative
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA’s) and a point of care serology test for
SARS-CoV-2 for Australia and New Zealand (Agreement). ELISA’s used for research only
do not require TGA approvals, therefore Cellmid will initially seek regulatory approval
from the TGA as well as import permits for a small selection of the devices, based on
their immediate utility, with others to follow based on demand. Cellmid will order
commercial quantities of the tests following regulatory approval.
The initial exclusivity period runs for six months from the date of signing the Agreement
with subsequent time extensions negotiated by mutual agreement thereafter.
Cellmid already has two agreements in place to access point of care and laboratorybased SARS-CoV-2 testing devices (ASX Announcements, 27 March 2020, 4 June 2020
and 2 July 2020). The Agreement with IMD provides the Company with access to
laboratory-based ELISA systems that can quantify the level and identify the type of
antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
The key advantage of the ELISA technology is that it can measure absolute levels of
antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens. In addition, ELISA’s normally have
lower level of detection limits compared to point of care devices increasing their
accuracy. Routinely used in most laboratories ELISA systems are essential in vaccine
trials, when monitoring the population after vaccine roll outs begin and, in tandem
with point of care screening, in serological surveys.
Cellmid’s partner, IMD, a spin off company from Hong Kong University and headed by
Professor Aimin Xu, is dedicated to the discovery, development, manufacture, and
distribution of in vitro diagnostics (IVD) for chronic and infectious diseases. IMD
codevelops its tests with Toronto Bioscience Inc., (Canada), who also acts as North
American distributor for the tests. All of the ELISA’s are currently sold in Europe and
Canada. The Immunodiagnostics branded tests are manufactured in IMD’s facilities in
Taiwan and China under ISO13485:2016 adhering to strict quality control and
validation.
The first product Cellmid will focus on is the CE Marked SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISA Kit for
the detection of IgG antibody specific for viral spike protein. Evaluation of the kit by
the manufacturer and by Hong Kong University State Key Laboratory of Biotechnology
using a stratified dataset comprising 273 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 542 preCOVID-19 control samples showed specificity of 99.08% and sensitivities of:

Day 0-7: 94.03% (n=67)
Day 8-14: 96.20% (n=79)
Day 14+: 100% (n=127)

Samples for the evaluations were sourced from the Centre for Disease Control at
Dongguan City and Shenzhen Sixth People’s Hospital in Shenzhen. The Agreement also
covers additional ELISA tests including the SARS-CoV-2 NP IgM ELISA Kit, SARS-CoV-2 NP
IgG ELISA Kit, SARS-CoV-2 NP total Antibody ELISA Kit and SARS-CoV-2 S1RBD IgG ELISA
Kit 1 . The suite of available tests has broad utility in different research and clinical
scenarios, allowing Cellmid to address various market needs.
In addition to the ELISA’s, a high-quality point of care serology device is also included
in the Agreement. The device detects both IgM and IgG specific to the nucleocapsid
protein of SARS-CoV-2, differentiating it from the viral spike protein detecting kits
already accessed by Cellmid. The Company is likely to seek regulatory approval from
the TGA for the device.
Evaluation of the point of care test by the manufacturer and by Hong Kong University
State Key Laboratory of Biotechnology using a stratified dataset comprising 273
confirmed COVID-19 patients and 542 pre-COVID-19 control samples showed an IgG
sensitivity of 96.1% and specificity of 96.1% at the most relevant period of 14+ days
following onset of symptoms and an IgM sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 97.4% at
the most relevant period of 0-7 days from symptoms. Samples for the evaluations were
sourced from the Centre for Disease Control at Dongguan City and Shenzhen Sixth
People’s Hospital in Shenzhen.
Approved for release by the Board of Directors of Cellmid.

The different ELISA kits measure antibodies that bind to different antigens on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The
specific antigen they bind to is incorporated in the name of the ELISA. The NP IgG ELISA measures IgG
antibodies specific to the nucleoplasmid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the S1 IgG ELISA measures IgG
antibodies specific to the spike protein of the SARS-coV-2 virus, the S1 RBD IgG ELISA measures antibodies
specific to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, the NP IgM ELISA measures the IgM antibodies
specific to the nucleoplasmid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the NP Ab ELISA measures the total
antibody specific to the nucleoplasmid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
