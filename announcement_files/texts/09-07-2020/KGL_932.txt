

Using pandemic delay period to optimise Jervois mine design and advance
project planning
As world copper market strengthens ahead of economic stimulus by
governments
Improved geological understanding of Jervois to deliver enhanced mine
planning

Summary
1. The Company used the delay caused by COVID-19 to optimise mine design and progress
the planning for the development of the Jervois project.
Geotechnical studies of the proposed open pit and underground mines were received. Work began
on re-optimising mine design at Reward to include consideration of the updated information of the
high grade intercepts identified from the latest drilling. Mining costs were re-assessed and
confirmed. Reviews of plans and costs of mineral processing and infrastructure continued. The
aim is that a Pre-feasibility Study will be released in Q4 2020.
2. Applying improved geological understanding is expected to deliver enhanced mine
planning.
Applying the increased knowledge base of the Jervois geology is leading to more efficient mine
design of both the proposed open pit and underground mines at the Reward deposit, where half of
the known Jervois mineral resource is located, and also the proposed mine at the Bellbird deposit.
Commenting on recent progress, Chairman Denis Wood said:
“The gathering strength of the world copper market encouraged us during the quarter in our work on
Jervois. The copper price is a key consideration in taking the project to development.
“We took the opportunity to revisit the geology and project planning during the period of delay caused
by the pandemic. The improved geological knowledge is being applied in mine planning. While the
successful drilling programs identified and delineated a high grade resource, these geological studies
have increased our structural understanding, particularly at the Reward deposit. Integrating the results
into mine planning will be crucial in maximising efficiency in ore recovery.
“This value adding outcome reinforces the importance of applying state of the art expertise to focus on
building a high grade mineable resource. It is the same principle we have adopted in using latest
exploration down hole electromagnetic (DHEM) surveying technologies to uncover exciting new
discoveries at Reward South and potentially at Bellbird South.
“We now have at Jervois not only the valuable resource on which our mine development planning is
based, but also the potential to expand Jervois beyond the initial project with further drilling.
“Geotechnical reports, mine design re-optimisation and processing and infrastructure planning and
costing are increasing our confidence in the project.”

1. The Company used the delay caused by COVID-19 to optimise mine design and progress
the planning for the development of the Jervois project.
During the quarter, KGL Resources Limited (ASX: KGL) (KGL or the Company) successfully progressed
studies and reviews of mining, processing and infrastructure for the Jervois project. The aim is that a
Pre-feasibility Study will be released in Q4 2020. The components of this study were well progressed
during the quarter.
Geotechnical
Detailed open pit and underground geotechnical reports were received from consultants in May.
Favourable ground conditions in the Rockface underground mining area support a top-down mining
strategy to target ore access sooner than would otherwise be possible. The available open pit data
was found to be of a high level of confidence for the proposed open pits at Reward and Bellbird, and
design parameters for the pits that are similar to those previously determined have been recommended.
Mine planning
A review of the underground mine plan for Rockface was completed and should result in higher
tonnages becoming available earlier in the mining sequence at costs similar to previous estimates.
A re-optimisation of the Reward open pit and underground mines commenced following the availability
of an updated geological model which includes the drilling completed late in 2019 and early in 2020.
Processing
A review of metallurgical testing was completed, to support metallurgical processing performance and
future projections.
A second review of processing costs was completed and gave a high level of confidence in previous
estimates used for planning. The process plant layout was developed and incorporated into the overall
site plan. This includes the capture of run-off for re-use in the process water supply.
Infrastructure
A review of power plant tenders included assessment of wind power in a hybrid diesel-solar plant.
A review of civil design – roads, water pond, tailings storage and other infrastructure – was completed.
A cost estimate has been received and is being reviewed.
Drone based high resolution imaging equipment was used to complete detailed topographic surveying
at the site.
Lease and licence applications for the water supply borefield were progressed.
Mining Management Plan
The Mining Management Plan was submitted to the Northern Territory Government in early April. Final
government approval of the project is expected during the September quarter.

2. Applying improved geological understanding is expected to deliver enhanced mine
planning.
During the quarter, the knowledge of the geology at Jervois that has been built up over several years
was brought to bear on the mine planning. This greater understanding was based on revised logging,
structural mapping and other procedures. The result has been an improved understanding of the
geology and the two groups into which most of the mineralisation is contained – a low grade strata form
domain, and a high grade domain enhanced by structural thickening and late stage hydrothermal fluids.
Much of the high grade copper is located in steeply plunging lenses at the Reward Main Lode and
Reward Deeps Lode. However, there is considerable recoverable copper located in the other generally
lower grade domain.
Understanding the internal distribution of the mineralisation is crucial for efficient mine planning. The
ongoing optimisation of mine design at Jervois is benefiting considerably by the application of the
steadily accumulated knowledge. It is leading to more efficient design of both the proposed open pit
and underground mine at Reward, where half of the known Jervois mineral resource is located, and
also at the proposed underground mine at the Bellbird deposit. The greater efficiency in ore recovery
will provide economic gains for the Jervois project.
World copper market
During the June quarter, directors were encouraged to see a strengthening of the global copper market
in the face of the pandemic as the Company continued to prepare for the development of the Jervois
project.
The rising copper demand lifted the price throughout last year to a peak of US$6327 a tonne on 14
January before it fell with the onset of the pandemic to a low of US$4630 on 23 March and was US$6082
on 8 July.
The market has been influenced by economic stimulus measures committed by governments, including
the $700 billion program by China where half of the world’s copper is consumed. These massive
injections of funds will be directed largely to metals-intensive infrastructure projects requiring large
volumes of copper. Adding to the optimism has been the apparent success in China of bringing the
coronavirus under control.
Copper supply is expected to struggle to meet growing demand created not only by the post-virus
stimulus measures, but also by the long term trend of strongly increasing copper consumption driven
by copper’s usage in consumer goods, electrical transmission, electric vehicles and renewable energy,
as well as infrastructure and construction.
CEO of Barrick Gold Corp Mark Bristow expressed the longer term positive outlook for copper when he
was widely reported as saying in February that copper will be “the most strategic metal on this planet”
in a decade.
Commodity research analysts are forecasting strong growth in demand for copper.
Writing last month that copper is an essential component of the energy technologies of the future, the
CEO of the European Copper Institute Bernard Respaut cited an International Energy Agency report
showing the significant amounts of copper required in many key renewable energy technologies –
offshore windmills need up to 7000 kg of copper and onshore windmills around 4000 kg of copper per
MW installed, photovoltaic panels around 2500 kg per MW of capacity, electric vehicles use three to
four times as much copper as conventional vehicles, and charging stations between 2.1 and 5.4 kg of
copper each.
Eurasia Group’s Henning Gloystein advised in a recent research note that the pandemic was expected
to accelerate trends in government-supported environmental investments and digitalization which
heralded a coming boom in copper demand. “Welcome to the age of copper,” he announced. Widescale
fiscal measures would help drive demand back to pre-crisis levels next year, with demand increasing
by 2.5% a year this decade towards 30 million tonnes a year by 2030.
Current supply is being constrained by recent mine closures and curtailed production in response to the
current economic slowdown. Copper stocks at the London Metal Exchange and in other warehouses

have fallen substantially during the past quarter. Looking further ahead, future mine production has
also been affected, with a pause created in plans to expand existing major mines and develop new
mines.
Adding to the potential for a supply deficit is the slowing rate of discovery of new copper deposits in the
last 10 years over the previous two decades, and the continuing problem of reducing grades particularly
in Latin America, the world’s largest copper producing region. A higher copper price will inevitably be
required to justify the development of lower grade deposits.
In summary, the copper price has been forecast to strengthen in both the short and longer term as
demand doubles over the next 20 to 30 years and supply is constrained and mine production costs rise.
Outlook
Pre-development planning for the Jervois project will continue in preparation for when economic and
market conditions are favourable. Northern Territory Government approval of the Mining Management
Plan is expected during the September quarter, and any accompanying conditions will be incorporated
into the modelling required to seek project financing.

Does the entity expect that it will continue to have the current level of net operating
cash flows for the time being and, if not, why not?

Answer:No, due to the health and safety concerns surrounding the CoVid-19 pandemic, the
Company’s site-based exploration activities have concluded, and personnel and
drilling equipment demobilised from the project site. There are no immediate plans
to re-establish site exploration activities.
2.

Has the entity taken any steps, or does it propose to take any steps, to raise further
cash to fund its operations and, if so, what are those steps and how likely does it
believe that they will be successful?

Answer: Yes, refer to the KGL Entitlement Issue announcement released to the ASX on 9
July 2020. Two major shareholders have committed to take up their share of the
rights issue (totalling 36% of the total entitlement offer), and the Directors are of the
belief that the offer will raise sufficient capital to fund the Company's ongoing
operations.
