Dear XCD Energy Securityholder

COMPULSORY ACQUISITION NOTICE
We refer to the off-market takeover offers by 88 Energy Limited (ACN 072 964 179) (88 Energy) for all of the fully
paid ordinary shares and listed options in XCD Energy Limited (ACN 108 403 425) (XCD Energy), the terms of which
were set out in 88 Energy’s replacement bidder’s statement dated 21 May 2020 (Offers).
As you may be aware, 88 Energy has a relevant interest in more than 90% of the shares and listed options on issue
in XCD Energy and has acquired more than 75% of the shares and listed options that it offered to acquire under the
Offers.

Accordingly, 88 Energy will now proceed to exercise its right to acquire the remaining XCD Energy shares and listed
options under the compulsory acquisition provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act).

On completion of the compulsory acquisition process, 88 Energy will issue to XCD Energy the consideration for the
XCD Energy shares and listed options that it compulsorily acquires. XCD Energy and listed optionholders whose
shares and listed options are compulsorily acquired will be sent a claim form by XCD Energy advising them how to
claim their bid consideration.

XCD Energy listed security holders should also be aware that they may not be able to sell their XCD Energy shares
