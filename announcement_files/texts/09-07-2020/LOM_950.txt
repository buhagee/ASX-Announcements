Does the entity expect that it will continue to have the current level of net operating cash
flows for the time being and, if not, why not?

Answer:
The below activities may result in a different level of net operating cash flows going forward to that
achieved in the Quarter. The Company successfully completed a rights issue in June 2020 (Refer ASX
announcement 3 June 2020) which raised A$5.2m (before costs). The proceeds will be used to
advance the search for the primary kimberlite sources of the high-value Lulo alluvial diamonds,
preserve mining assets suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and for general working
capital purposes. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is being actively reviewed and the Company
expects to return Mothae to full operation status as soon as the pandemic and market constraints
allow.
