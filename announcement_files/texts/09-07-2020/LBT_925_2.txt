Details of Share Purchase Plan

For personal use only

The Company is also pleased to announce the terms of an offer to eligible shareholders of the Company with a registered
address in Australia or New Zealand (Eligible Shareholders) to subscribe for new fully paid ordinary shares in the Company
(SPP Shares) under a Share Purchase Plan (SPP). The SPP will allow Eligible Shareholders to each subscribe for up to
$30,000 worth of new ordinary shares in the Company at 16 cents per SPP Share, (SPP Price) without incurring brokerage
or other transaction costs. The SPP Price is the same as the Placement Price.
The SPP Offer has obtained the benefit of the ASX ‘Class Wavier Decision – Temporary Extra Placement Capacity’ dated
23 April 2020 for the purposes of conducting a security purchase plan at a price no greater than the Placement Price, such
that the SPP Shares will not be counted towards the 15% limit on the issue of securities without Shareholder approval
pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 7.1, or the 10% limit on the issue of securities without Shareholder approval pursuant to ASX
Listing Rule 7.1A.
The SPP is targeted to raise $1 million and will not be underwritten. The $1 million target is the estimated amount the
Company believes balances the likely demand for the SPP Offer and an amount sufficient to provide existing shareholders
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the capital raising at the same price as the Placement. The directors have
reserved the right to accept oversubscriptions under the SPP to ensure all Eligible Shareholders do have a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the SPP. Any level of over subscriptions not accepted will be scaled back on a pro rata basis to
each participant based on the number of securities validly applied for.

Eligible Shareholders
Eligible Shareholders who are registered holders of shares in the Company at 7.00pm (ACST) on Wednesday 8 July 2020
with a registered address in Australia or New Zealand, provided that such Shareholder is not in the United States, or acting
for the account or benefit of a person in the United States. The SPP is also being extended to Eligible Shareholders who are
Custodians to participate in the SPP on behalf of eligible beneficiaries.
The key terms of the Share Purchase Plan are as follows:
•
•

Each Eligible Shareholder is limited to participating in the SPP to the amount of $30,000 worth of SPP Shares;
The SPP is optional and the right to participate in the SPP will not be transferable. All SPP Shares will rank equally
with existing fully paid ordinary shares in the Company.
• The issue price of Shares under the SPP is the same as the issue price of the Placement Shares and represents a
discount of:
o 15.8% to last traded price of 19.0 cents on 06 July 2020
o 21.9% discount to the 5-day volume weighted average price (VWAP), 17.0% discount to the 15-day VWAP
and 7.2% discount to the 30-day VWAP, on 06 July 2020
An SPP Offer Booklet with further details on the SPP is expected to be despatched to shareholders on or about Friday 17
July 2020.
