about 100 km SW of Coober Pedy, and
50km NE of the Challenger Gold 1 mine
… in the highly prospective and under-explored Woomera Defence Area.

• Aurora Tank was featured in ‘Top Drill Intersections per State – Australia – Q1 2019’ published by the
RSC Mineral Intelligence Report (May 2019) and is yielding multiple high-grade intersections such as:

Low-cost Low-capex
Heap Leach Pathway
“

Marmota has been investigating the optimal pathway to
production at Aurora Tank. The excellent column leach
test gold recoveries suggest that Aurora Tank is
amenable to low-cost low-capex heap leach techniques.
A heap leach means that Marmota would not need to
construct a mill, nor share revenue with external parties
for toll treatment in a mill. This is a highly desirable
outcome for both the Company and our shareholders. ”

Transitioning from:

Discovery

Production

To expedite the process, Marmota is progressing in parallel:

Drilling
Extensions to NW flank, to NE, to E, and to depth (July/Aug 2020); following primary mineralisation;
and selected in-fill drilling to aid resource modelling and optimal pit design; density estimation; feasibility study

Infrastructure and Approvals
New Director of Production (Shane Barker) appointed, semi-permanent camp being installed (July 2020),
consultants being appointed for necessary environmental, hydrological, hydrogeology approvals etc

Potential Strategic Acquisition

For personal use only

Aurora Tank

! Marmota has a dominant land holding (6,000 km2), and is
interested to further increase it

Gawler Craton

! Marmota has made an open offer to acquire neighbour Tyranna’s Jumbuck
project (predominantly adjacent tenements – see next map) for $1.3 million
(consisting of $1m cash and $300,000 in MEU shares to TYX holders).
[ ASX:MEU 14 May 2020 ]

! Marmota’s offer is superior in every respect to an offer to acquire the same
asset by suspended entity Syngas for $950,000 cash.
! Tyranna shareholders are to vote on 31 July 2020 [ ASX:TYX 1 July 2020 ]
whether to accept or reject the Syngas offer. If they reject the Syngas offer,
Tyranna would be able to accept the superior MEU offer.

Uranium Asset: Strategic Review Underway

For personal use only

Background

Given Marmota’s present focus and success in making new gold discoveries at Aurora Tank,
newer shareholders may be unaware that:
1. Marmota started out as a successful uranium explorer
2. Marmota has a substantial Uranium JORC Inferred Resource at Junction Dam
3. Junction Dam is strategically situated adjoining the Boss (ASX:BOE) Honeymoon uranium mine tenement –
which is 1 of just 4 permitted uranium mines in Australia
4. By the end of 2014, Marmota had spent over A$8 million developing its uranium project [ ASX:MEU 29 Sept 2014 ]
5. Marmota owns 100% of the uranium rights at Junction Dam
6. Marmota has not been active on uranium since 2014

New Developments

! Recently, uranium prices have started rising significantly for the first time in many years.
! Sentiment in the uranium sector has significantly improved, and continues to improve.
! Boss Resources (ASX:BOE) – owners of the Honeymoon plant 15km away – appear to be making solid
progress towards bringing the Honeymoon plant back into operation.
! The MEU Board has commenced a strategic review of its uranium assets to add value to shareholders.

Uranium JORC Resource

Marmota currently has:

• JORC Inferred Resource of 5.4 million pounds U3O8 [ Saffron deposit ]
with average grade of 557ppm U3O8 [ ASX:MEU 18 Nov 2011, 20 Feb 2012, 17 July 2013 ]
•

Overall Exploration Target* of 22–33 million pounds U3O8
at approx. 400 to 700 ppm U3O8
[ ASX:MEU 9 July 2012 ]
[ Uranium price is currently around A$47 per pound ]

• Assay grades of up to 8,143ppm U3O8 at the Saffron deposit
•
•
•

Starting from the western tenement boundary, grades increase as one heads east into
the Junction Dam tenement.
Potential to increase size of resource with further drilling.
NW bend never tested by Marmota.

* Saffron deposit with Bridget and Yolanda prospects: see ASX:MEU 9 July 2012. The potential quantity and grade of an Exploration Target is conceptual in nature.
The estimates of Exploration Targets should not be misunderstood or misconstrued as estimates of Mineral Resources. It is uncertain if further exploration over
those zones currently defined by an Exploration Target will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource.

Cautionary Statement
The estimates of exploration target sizes mentioned above should not be misunderstood or misconstrued as estimates of Mineral Resources. The estimates of exploration target
sizes are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient results received from drilling completed to date to estimate a Mineral Resource compliant with the JORC Code (2004)
guidelines. Furthermore, it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource.
Forward Looking Statement
This report may contain forward looking statements that are subject to risk factors which are based on MEU’s expectations relating to future events. Forward-looking statements are

Competent Persons Statement
Information in this exploration update relating to Exploration Targets, Exploration Results and Mineral Resources is based on information compiled by Dr Kevin Wills, who is a
Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. He has sufficient experience which is relevant to the styles of mineralisation and types of deposits under
consideration and to the activities being undertaken to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the “ Australasian Code of Reporting of Exploration Results,
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.” Dr Wills consents to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.
