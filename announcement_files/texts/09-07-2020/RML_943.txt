OPERATIONS UPDATE 64NORTH PROJECT, ALASKA

Summary
• Airborne geophysical surveys (ZTEM and Magnetics) have commenced
The surveys aim to:
o Define drill targets on the Echo Prospect, ready for drilling in August
o Compare Echo, Aurora and neighbouring Goodpaster Prospect
o Enhance drill targeting on the 2km x 5km Aurora Prospect
Survey completion, results and analysis expected in 2 weeks
• Drilling operations are ongoing at the Aurora Prospect hole #4
o Drilling at 795m depth continuing in the “right rocks” (paragneiss)
o Drilling confirms the CSAMT conductor matches predicted alterations zones
o Assay results planned to be released upon program completion
o Drilling operations are ongoing, 1410m completed of a 2300m (minimum) program

Resolution Minerals Ltd (RML or Company) is pleased to announce that planned ZTEM data acquisition commenced
on 8 July 2020, with the heli-borne magnetic survey to follow (Figure 1). The new data will be analysed in conjunction
with knowledge leant from the current drilling and CSAMT data to define new drill targets and refine existing drill
targeting.
ZTEM (Z-Axis Tipper Electromagnetic System) is a passive EM technique used to map subsurface resistivity and
conductivity. ZTEM can penetrate conductive cover (often causing interference in other EM systems) to depths
beyond 1km and is excellent for discriminating subtle resistivity contrasts. The heli-borne magnetic data will be used
to define the likely structural controls for mineralisation within the prospect areas.
The Goodpaster Prospect and Pogo Gold Mine are structurally controlled, with alteration and associated gold and
sulphide mineralised zones expressed as subtle resistivity contrasts (i.e. weakly conductive). Therefore, the
combination of close spaced airborne ZTEM and magnetics data, with existing wide spaced ground acquired CSAMT
lines will be a very powerful tool for defining drill targets within an Intrusion-related Gold System (IRGS) setting.
Furthermore, RML is collecting data across neighbouring Northern Star’s (ASX:NST) Goodpaster Prospect
to allow for direct comparison with potential targets on RML’s ground (Figure 1).

further drill holes (orange dots). CSAMT Lines 3 and 6 (dashed black lines) running north-south.

Aurora Prospect
RML’s Aurora Prospect is a large-scale potential, high priority target zone (2km x 5km), with host rocks, surface
geochemistry, structures and geophysical signature that make it a look-alike to the Goodpaster Prospect and Pogo
Gold Mine (Figure 1 and Figure 2) Drilling operations are continuing on the Aurora Prospect.

Echo Prospect
The Echo Prospect in the north of the West Pogo Block is directly down dip from the Goodpaster Prospect (Figure
1). A single line of CSAMT survey data collected in 2019 identified a number of valid drill targets, on a narrow corridor
through the centre of the Echo Prospect (Figure 1). The airborne surveys are a cost-effective means to widen the
zone of potential drill targets. Ground preparation in July will allow RML to be drill ready for August.

Drilling operations progress
The first hole was completed on 23 June 2020 to a depth of 615m on Target A6 (Hole ID: 20AU003). The drill rig
then shifted to Target A13NE (Hole ID: 20AU004) and has now reached a depth of 795m. Both holes have intersected
the targeted paragneiss rock type, which is the same host rock as the Pogo Gold Mine and validated the CSAMT
survey data used in targeting (Figure 2).

Current Hole: 20AU004 (A13NE) is located alongside an interpreted vertical feeder which is likely a conduit of
mineralised fluids from depth and the source of the high grade rock chips up to 13.85 g/t Au at surface at the “Half
Ounce Gulch” gold occurrence. Historic drill holes MR12-01 and MR12-02 drilled at a 45º dip and intersected narrow
gold veins up to 1.71g/t Au but did not test the deeper flat lying conductive horizon (Figure 3).
Encouragingly the 20AU004 (A13NE) CSAMT target correlates with zones of alteration and associated sulphides,
within paragneiss. The geology team is continuing to assess all new results to optimise drill hole locations and
maximise use of funds.

Drilling now

Figure 3 CSAMT Line 3 Section with 45º dip historic holes MR12-01 Azimuth 153º and MR12-02 Azimuth 94º were not drilled on
same plane as CSAMT (180º) and therefore has not tested the prospective conductive target zone at 400m to 1000m depth.
