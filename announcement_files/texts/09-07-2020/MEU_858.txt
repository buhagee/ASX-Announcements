Dear Sir/Madam
REQUEST FOR TRADING HALT (2+2)
The Directors of Marmota Limited request under Listing Rule 17.1 the ASX grant an immediate
trading halt to the company’s securities (ASX code: MEU), pending an announcement by the
Company regarding a proposed capital raising to sophisticated and professional investors.
The Company requests two consecutive “back to back” trading halts of two days each for the
purpose of considering, planning and executing the capital raising, which will remain in place
until not later than the commencement of trading on Wednesday 15 July 2020.

The Company is not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be granted.

Yours faithfully

Lisa Askham-Levy
Company Secretary
