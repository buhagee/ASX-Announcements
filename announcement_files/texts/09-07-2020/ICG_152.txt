Drill targeting continues without delaying permitting

Au and Cu soil geochemical heat maps greatly enhance porphyry, skarn and epithermal prospectivity of
the NE, Pampa Corral, SW and Ajo Orjo areas

Inca Minerals Limited (Inca or the Company) has received a Au soil geochemical heat map1 (heat map) and a Cu
heat map covering the Riqueza Project area (Figures 1 and 4). The heat maps were generated by the independent
consultancy that has provided the Company an exploration review initial drill recommendations report (subject
of ASX announcement dated 30 June 2020). The heat maps were generated as part of continued drill
recommendations and drill hole design.
Fourteen discrete drill targets prospective for porphyry, skarn, epithermal, carbonate replacement and volcanichosted massive sulphide styles of mineralisation (ASX announcement 30 June 2020). The number of targets
warranting drill testing is set to increase. This will be done without delaying the permitting process.

Gold Heat Map
The Au heat map (Figure 1) shows elevated Au in soils within the NE, Pampa Corral, SW, Ajo Orjo and extreme
SW areas of the Project (Figure 2). Gold anomalism associated with the SW, Pampa Corral and Ajo Orjo area
might reasonably be associated with and indicative of epithermal and porphyry mineralisation.
Two areas of Au soil anomalism are singled out. The extensive Au anomaly in the NE and the Au anomaly in the
SW corner, the latter newly elevating this area in prospectivity.
The large Au soil anomalies of the NE Area closely coincide with previously reported integrated targets and
proposed drilling. Importantly, elevated gold in limestone, which is a rock type with very low gold levels in normal
circumstances, is very highly significant. It is highly indicative of intrusion related mineralisation, including either
porphyry and/or skarn mineralisation.
The SW corner of Riqueza hosts a large Au soil anomaly. It also hosts two large priority-3 airborne magnetic and
radiometric (AMAGRAD) targets, Yanaranra P-3 and Terciopelo P-3. These AMAGRAD targets host strong
magnetic lows, intrusive-related magnetic highs and radiometric alteration halos. In general, despite their lower
initial rating, the Yanaranra P-3 and Terciopelo P-3 targets are similar to the AMAGRAD targets of the NE Area
(Figure 3). In lieu of later interpretations, the overall rating of the SE corner has significantly increased. This is
especially true now that a large Au soil anomaly occurs in this area.

QGIS heat maps are visual representations of a data range of the selected property. In this case, the selected properties are
Au and Cu assay values. The heat maps do not reflect absolute values (no grades are given). The hot spots reflect the top
values within the range of the Au and Cu data. The halos are the upper values of the same data.

Copper Heat Map
The Cu heat map (Figure 4) shows elevated Cu in soils in three very large expanses across the NE, Pampa Corral,
SW and Ajo Orjo areas, and in smaller zones in the SE corner of the project and along the southern margin of the
Project area (Figure 5).

The similarities between the SW corner
and the NE Area are highlighted. Both
areas comprise broad magnetic lows (dark
blue coloured areas) within which are
small magnetic highs (orange and yellow
coloured areas). The SW corner is
increasingly seen as an area of interest and
it is likely drill holes will be proposed for
this area to test for epithermal and
porphyry mineralisation. Note that some
prospect names are not mentioned. This is
because the original diagram predates their
discovery.

The Cu anomalism associated with the SW, Pampa Corral and Ajo Orjo might reasonably be associated with and
indicative of epithermal and porphyry mineralisation. This is consistent with the Au results which is especially
relevant to Cu-Au porphyry mineralisation. It should be recalled that a Cu-Au porphyry is known 5km southeast
Riqueza, partially owned by Anglo American.
The large Cu soil halo and four Cu centres of the NE Area closely coincide with previously reported integrated
targets and proposed drilling. This, combined with the Au soil anomalism, elevates this area still further in terms
of porphyry and skarn mineralisation. A Cu-Mo skarn prospect is known immediately west of Riqueza, owned by
BHP.
The SW Corner, previously discussed in term of its gold anomalism (Figures 1 and 2), also hosts copper anomalism
(Figures 4 and 5). This new area is discussed in more detail below.

current proposed drill holes, the IP survey coverage (green solid lines) and the interpreted IP anomalies. This figure appears
in ASX announcement dated 3o June 2020.

The Riqueza Project area hosts large expanses of Au and Cu soil anomalism as discussed above. Importantly in
many place Au and Cu occur together (Figure 6).
The NE Area, which predominantly comprises limestone, hosts a very large Au-Cu soil anomaly that cannot be
attributed to any un-mineralised limestone. It is concluded that this Au-Cu area indicates the presence of either
or both porphyry and skarn mineralisation. The coincidence of strong AMAGRAD and IP geophysical targets (ASX
announcement 16 June 2020) at depth provides further compelling evidence of this.

coincidence becomes apparent in this diagram. An interpreted Transfer Zone (Figure 7) is also shown (black dashed lines).

The SW and Ajo Orjo Areas are similar to each other. Indeed, the Cu halo (Figures 5 and 6) link these prospective
areas. These areas, including the Uchpanga, Colina Roja, Cuncayoc Copper, Alteration Ridge, Huasijaja and Ajo
Orjo prospects that occur within them, are all prospective for epithermal and porphyry mineralisation.
The far SW corner, hereafter referred to as the Terciopelo Area is now recognised as an area prospective for
epithermal and porphyry mineralisation and warrants drill testing. The relatively low rating of the AMGARAD
targets at this location meant that the area was not covered in expert mapping, sampling and IP. Nevertheless,
the Au-Cu anomalism and juxtaposition with the rhyolite dome elevates it in terms of drill testing.
In addition to the significance of the Au and Cu hot spots and halos as indictors of subsurface mineralisation, the
overall configuration of the Au-Cu halo is also telling. The halos show a SW to NE trend across the Project area.
They reflect, and lay within, a previously interpreted regional structural Transfer Zone. Transfer Zones are major
crustal “tears” (faults) and are critical in the emplacement and development of very large scale (tier 1) deposits
along the Andean Miocene porphyry belt (Figure 7). The interpretation of the Transfer Zone, that is reflected in
Au and Cu halos, adds to the prospectivity of Riqueza significantly.

Figure 7 ABOVE: Extract from a Company report on the
AMAGRAD survey conducted in 2018. The map shows
the location of the Antamina tier-1 skarn Cu-Zn mine in
relation to a Transfer Zone. Other large epithermalporphyry mines are indicated (Yanacocha, Pierina, Cerro
de Pasco). LEFT: Another extract from the same
AMAGRAD report. The map shows regional geology and
a stylised Project area block with the interpreted
Transfer Zone traversing it. The “jolt” to the regional
geology caused by the Transfer Zone is clearly shown by
the displacement of the Jumasha limestone (green
areas). The two prospects that are shown were among
those known at the time of the report―Inca’s
Humaspunco Prospect and BHP’s Kenita skarn
prospect).

The Pampa Corral Area is of particular interest on the basis of its general location. This prospect area occurs on
the regional boundary between the volcanics (at surface and to the south) and the limestones (at depth and to
the north). It is also in close proximity to known epithermal mineralisation at Uchpanga, Colina Roja and
Cuncayoc Copper and hosts known hydrothermally altered intrusions, including a monzodiorite stock. It is
therefore uniquely prospective for epithermal, porphyry and skarn mineralisation.

The desk-top studies, the subject of this announcement, are part of a drill target generation and refinement
campaign. Such studies do not and will not delay the progress of drill permitting. Rather, studies such as these
are designed to increase strength of drill purpose and prioritisation, and to the extent possible, de-risk the
proposed drilling.
The Company has already engaged and has met with a drill permit service provider, specialised in this field, and
drill permit options have been discussed. The Company is keen to fast-track permitting to commence drilling in
the shortest possible timeframe.

Magnetic Survey

Radiometric Survey

AMAGRAD
Induced polarization

IP Survey
Geochemistry(-ical)
Porphyry (Deposit)

Said of a geophysical survey in which the geophysical tool is above the ground.
An exploration method using instruments to collect and analyse properties as magnetics,
radioactivity, gravity, electronic conductivity, etc. Instruments can be located on surface (ground
survey) or above the ground (airborne survey).
Measures variations in the intensity of the earth’s magnetic field caused by the contrasting content
of rock-forming magnetic minerals in the Earth’s crust. This allows sub-surface mapped of geology,
including Structures. An airborne survey is flown either by plane or helicopter with the
magnetometer kept at a constant height above the surface.
Or gamma-ray spectrometric survey measures concentrations of radio-elements potassium (K),
uranium (U) and thorium (Th), specifically the gamma rays emitted by isotopes of these elements.
All rocks and soils contain radioactive isotopes and almost all gamma-rays detected at surface are
the result of radioactive decay of K, U and Th. Radiometrics is therefore capable of directly detecting
potassic alteration which is associated with hydrothermal processing and formation of deposits.
Acronym for Airborne Magnetic and Radiometric survey.
(IP) is the Earth’s capacity to hold an electric charge over time. IP measures the voltage decay curve
(or loss) after the injected current is shut off. The higher the IP, the longer over time the charge is
held (or retained) (chargeability). IP decays (or fades away) over a period of time, typically a few
seconds but sometimes up to minutes, and will eventually disappear. Rocks, and more relevantly,
mineralisation, have IP signatures that can be recognised in the data.
IP chargeability is a derivative of resistivity—in order to measure IP, resistivity is first measured. IP is
measured at the end of a resistivity cycle.
•
DC electric current is transmitted into the ground through two electrode stakes that are
driven into the ground. The resulting electric potential field is measured between two
other electrode stakes.
•
Raw measured data—i.e., apparent resistivity values—are inverted to produce a model of
the true subsurface resistivity distribution.
•
A time component is added to derive IP.
•
IP chargeability and resistivity false-colour “heat” profiles are a way of presenting IP data.
A ground geophysical method involving the measurement of the slow decay of voltage in the ground
following the cessation of an excitation current pulse.
The study of the distribution and amounts of the chemical elements in minerals, ores, rocks, soils,
water and the atmosphere.
A type of deposit containing ore-forming minerals occurring as disseminations and veinlets in a large
volume of rock. The rock is typically porphyritic (a texture of large crystals in a fine groundmass).
Porphyry deposits are economically very significant.

Selected Key Words Used in this Announcement cont…

Deposit

Mineralisation

Epithermal
Intermediate
Sulphidation

A type of deposit that forms as a result of alteration which occurs when hydrothermal fluids interact
either igneous or sedimentary rocks. In many cases, skarns are associated with the intrusion o
granitic rocks, especially Porphyry intrusions, in and around faults that intrude into a limestone.
A deposit is a naturally occurring accumulation or concentration of metals or minerals of sufficient
size and concentration that might, under favourable circumstances, have economic value
(Geoscience Australia). It is not a defined term in the JORC Code 2012 for Australasian Reporting of
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC 2012).
A general term describing the process or processes by which a mineral or minerals are introduced
into a rock (or geological feature such as a vein, fault, etc…). In the strictest sense, mineralisation
does not necessarily involve a process or processes involving ore-forming minerals. Nevertheless,
mineralisation is very commonly used to describe a process or processes in which ore-forming
minerals are introduced into a rock at concentrations that are economically valuable or potentially
valuable. The potential mineralisation occurring at Riqueza is epithermal, porphyry and porphyryrelated.
Said of hydrothermal processes occurring at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 200°C, and within
1,000m of the Earth’s surface.
Please refer to inserts immediately below (from Andrew Jackson, Sprott International).
Commonly abbreviated IS.

Hydrothermal
Of, or pertaining to “hot water” usually used in the context of ore-forming processes.
Carbonate
A process in which carbonate minerals are “replaced” by another mineral or minerals.
Replacement (Deposit) A Manto is a form of Carbonate Replacement inasmuch as the carbonate minerals of a limestone layer
are “replaced” by ore-forming minerals like sphalerite and galena.
Limestone
A calcium carbonate sedimentary rock typically formed by ancient coral reefs.
Volcanics
A large group of igneous rocks that are derived from magma of various compositions that area
extruded and cooled at the surface.
Andesite(-istic)
An igneous rock in composition between basalt and rhyolite. Though described as a volcanic igneous
rock as a constitute of a sill, it is “sub-volcanic” being emplaced not at the surface, but just below it.
Porphyritic
Said of a texture of an igneous rock where the large crystals are set in a groundmass of very fine
crystals. In this context, porphyritic does not refer or describes porphyry mineralisation. Confusingly,
porphyry mineralisation is typically hosted in porphyritic igneous rocks.
Sill
A tabular igneous intrusion that parallels the planar structure of the surrounding rock.
Dyke
A tabular igneous intrusion that cuts across the planar structure of the surrounding rock.
Red-beds
A sequence of oxidised sediments that are typically red (Fe-rich) in colour.
Rhyolite Dome
A steep sided, rounded extrusion (quasi-intrusive) of highly viscous magma erupted from a volcano.
Domes often occur within volcano craters, which may be later eroded away leaving a high
topographic dome feature.
Rhyolite(-ic)
A classification of a group of igneous rocks generally porphyritic which exhibit flow texture. Rhyolitic
is term describing rhyolite characteristics.
Intrusion (-ive)
The process of emplacement of magma in pre-existing country rock.
Country Rock
Rock that encloses or is cut by mineralisation. And more broadly, rock that makes up the geology of
an area.

Criteria: Drill hole information
A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
•
•
•
•
•

Easting and northing of the drill hole collar
Elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar.
Dip and azimuth of the hole.
Down hole length and interception depth.
Hole length.

Company Commentary
No drilling or drilling results are referred to in this announcement.
JORC CODE Explanation
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not material and this exclusion does not detract
from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
Company Commentary
No drilling or drilling results are referred to in this announcement.

Criteria: Data aggregation methods
JORC CODE Explanation
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of
high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths
of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and
some typical examples of such aggregations shown in detail
Company Commentary
No new sampling or new assay results of sampling are referred to in this announcement. The two new QGIS soil geochemical
heat maps the subject of this announcement have used geochemical data, from an antecedent program, previously released
to the market. In terms of the soil samples data, no weighted averages, maximum/minimum truncations and cut-off grades
were applied to assay reporting in this announcement.
JORC CODE Explanation
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.
Company Commentary
No metal equivalents are referred to in this announcement.

Criteria: Relationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths
JORC CODE Explanation
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole
length, true width not known.’)
Company Commentary
No new sampling or new assay results of sampling (including drilling) are referred to in this announcement. The two new
QGIS soil geochemical heat maps the subject of this announcement have used geochemical data, from an antecedent
program, previously released to the market. An independent consultancy using their own data methods generated the above
mentioned QGIS soil geochemical heat maps. The data used was that of soil assay collected on a 200m x 200m grid. The
anomaly zones defined on subsequent plans reflect possible buried mineralisation with orientations currently unknown.
