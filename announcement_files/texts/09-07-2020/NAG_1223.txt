ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
REDCASTLE GEOPHYSICAL AND DRILLING PROGRAMS
Mawson Resources Limited (“Mawson”) (TSX: MAW) yesterday
issued a news release to the Toronto Stock Exchange regarding
Nagambie Resources’ 100%-owned Redcastle exploration licence
EL5546 in central Victoria. A geophysical contractor will mobilize to
site during July, followed by a diamond drilling contractor in late
August 2020. The geophysical program will include ground
magnetics, gravity and gradient array induced polarization ("IP") to
test the entire Redcastle mineralizing system.

The link for the Toronto Stock Exchange is https://tsx.com and the
“Q” symbol to be input for Mawson is MAW. Clicking “News” then
brings up all the MAW releases, starting with the newest release.
Mawson has the option to earn an up to 70% joint venture interest in
the Redcastle project from Nagambie Resources by incurring the
following exploration expenditures: A$100,000 in the first year and an
additional A$150,000 in year 2 to earn 25%, an additional A$250,000
in year 3 to earn 50% and an additional A$500,000 by year 5 to earn
70%. Once Mawson earns 70%, a joint venture between the parties
will be formed. Nagambie Resources may then contribute its 30%
share of further exploration expenditures or, if it chooses to not
contribute, dilute its interest. Should Nagambie Resources’ interest
be reduced to less than 5.0%, it will be deemed to have forfeited its
interest in the joint venture to Mawson in exchange for a 1.5% net
smelter return royalty ("NSR") on gold revenue. Should Nagambie
Resources be granted the NSR, Mawson will have the right to acquire
the NSR for A$4,000,000. Mawson is also a significant shareholder
of Nagambie Resources, currently owning 10% of the shares on
issue.

NAGAMBIE RESOURCES
Exploration for Fostervillestyle, structural-controlled,
high grade sulphide-gold
underground deposits within
3,600 sq km of Waranga
Domain tenements is being
methodically carried out
using geophysical targeting
techniques, diamond drilling
and analysis for hydrothermal
alteration of the sediments.
Underwater storage of
sulphidic excavation
material (WASS / PASS) in
the two legacy gold pits at
the Nagambie Mine is an
excellent environmental fit
with major infrastructure
projects for Melbourne such
as Metro Rail, West Gate
Tunnel and North-East Link.
Recycling of the tailings
and overburden dumps can
produce aggregates for
concrete and gravel
products respectively.
Quarrying and screening of
sand deposits at the mine to
produce various sand and
quartz aggregate products is
planned.
The first landfill site is
planned to take advantage
of the 17 Ha of engineered
black plastic under the mine
tailings pad.
