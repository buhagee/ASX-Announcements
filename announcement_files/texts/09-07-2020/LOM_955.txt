SML’s operations were slowed very early in the Quarter to essential operations as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, but due to the easing of certain restrictions during the Quarter, SML was able to
bring production back to ~50% capacity in May 2020. SML has since commenced a staged ramp up
back to full production capacity.
Kimberlite exploration at Lulo continued during the Quarter with delineation drilling at L071 being
completed and commencing the planned bulk sampling campaign. The first kimberlite bulk sample
was excavated towards the end of June, with processing planned for the third quarter.
Due to the COVID-19 restrictions impacting on the health & safety and movement of personnel as
well as critical mine supplies, operations were suspended at the Mothae kimberlite mine in March
2020. Lucapa and Mothae have been investigating a number of options to re-start the Mothae mine.
The Company will update the market on the conclusion of this workstream and looks forward to recommencing operations as pandemic and market constraints allow.

LULO, ANGOLA
KIMBERLITE EXPLORATION
(Project Lulo – Lucapa 39% JV partner and operator, Endiama 51% and Rosas & Petalas 10%)
As set out in the ASX announcement of 23 March 2020, the Canguige catchment area became the
focus of the Lulo kimberlite exploration program following the recovery of 45 diamonds of up to 3.75
carats from a stream sample taken from the Canguige tributary.
The L071 and L072 kimberlites were in a group of 5 kimberlites in the Canguige catchment “top-rated”
during the kimberlite review compiled in 2019 and have been the focus due to their proximity to the
main tar road and its relatively dry ground conditions enabling better access following a prolonged
Angolan wet season.
Delineation drilling during the Quarter focused on the L071 and L072 kimberlites. 42 holes were
completed for a total of 1,424m, to identify volcaniclastic kimberlite (“VK”) material, to define their
structure and surface area and to locate the most suitable sites to take bulk samples. VK material
was identified at both kimberlites.
Excavation of two ~2,000 tonne VK bulk samples at L071 has now commenced at the selected sites
(Refer ASX announcement 26 June 2020). Transport of the VK material from one of the sites to a
proximal sample stockpile area close to the tar road has been completed. A transport contractor has
been engaged to move the samples to the Lulo plant.
As a result of the low-grade (low diamond count per tonne/ cubic metre) and high-value environment
in the Cacuilo valley of the greater Lulo concession, recovery expectations from any potential source
kimberlite will be for similar low-grade and high-value diamonds.
The systematic drilling and bulk sampling of the 5 most prospective kimberlites within the Canguige
catchment area (Figure 1) and the other 11 most prospective kimberlites in the wider Canguige valley
will continue throughout 2020 and into 2021.
Additional follow-up stream bulk samples are being planned for the Canguige catchment area and
the bulk sampling of other tributaries to the Cacuilo river will continue. Gravel has been defined in
the Xangando drainage which will be further investigated through drilling and pitting in preparation
for sample excavation.

Kimberlite licence
During the Quarter, Lucapa continued discussions with the Angolan Ministry of Mineral Resources
and Petroleum and Angola’s national diamond company Endiama E.P. to further securing a majority
stake in the Project Lulo joint venture, which holds the primary (kimberlite) exploration licence for
the 3,000km2 Lulo diamond concession. The progress of those discussions has been impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions but will be resumed as soon as travel restrictions are eased.
ALLUVIAL MINING
(Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo (“SML”) - Lucapa 40% associate and operator, Endiama 32% and Rosas
& Petalas 28%)
Mining operations
Volume processed and carats recovered during the Quarter were impacted by the State of Emergency
implemented in Angola as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a reduction in production
compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019 (Table 3). A much improved third quarter is expected
as Lulo ramped back to full production capacity at the end of the Quarter.
A total of 2,944 carats were produced during the Quarter and the diamond recoveries included
86 diamonds +4.8 carats, which in turn included 30 Specials.
The largest diamond recovered during the Quarter was a 171 carat gem-quality stone recovered from
Mining Block 06. This was the 15th +100 carat diamond recovered to date (Refer ASX announcement
11 May 2020).

Alluvial resource
Although slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, SML auger drilling programs continued to delineate
additional alluvial diamond-bearing gravels during the Quarter, in both the terraces and flood plain
(leziria) areas along the Cacuilo River.
During the Quarter 814 auger holes were completed for a total of 7,731m.
The high-interest leziria areas became more accessible as ground conditions dried and improved
during the Quarter following the end of the wet season. This led to the discovery and delineation of
new extensive gravel deposits within the Mining Block 06 leziria area, which returned a high average
grade of 17.5cphm3 when the gravel was mined and treated towards the end of the Quarter.

For personal use only

The 3,346 carat parcel of Lulo diamonds was sold by SML into the cutting & polishing partnership
with leading international manufacturing group Safdico International (“Safdico”), a subsidiary of
Graff International, one of the world’s finest high-end jewellery houses.
Under this partnership agreement SML is paid the full rough market value of the diamonds and shares
in a significant portion of polished margins generated thereafter.
MOTHAE KIMBERLITE MINE, LESOTHO
(Mothae Diamonds (Pty) Ltd - Lucapa 70%; Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho 30%)
Mining operations
Due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operation, Mothae remained on care and
maintenance for the whole Quarter.
As alluded to in the Q1 2020 quarterly (Refer ASX announcement 27 April 2020), Lucapa and Mothae
management have during the care & maintenance period continued to investigate and scope
opportunities to restart the Mothae mine as soon as possible. This modelling has included identifying
low-cost modifications to the treatment plant that could see capacity increase by ~60% to 1.8Mtpa
from the current nameplate capacity of 1.1Mtpa. The Company will update the market on the
conclusion of this workstream and looks forward to re-commencing operations as pandemic and
market constraints allow.

QUARTERLY ACTIVITIES REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
Due to the impact of COVID-19 on international travel and the inability to sell diamonds through the
regular tender channel in Belgium during the Quarter, Mothae accessed alternate sales solutions.

For personal use only

Cutting and polishing partnership
Mothae sold its first full parcel of 3,962 carats into a cutting and polishing partnership with a highend diamantaire during the Quarter (Refer ASX announcement 14 April 2020).
Under this partnership agreement Mothae is paid the full rough market value of the diamonds and
shares in a significant portion of polished margins generated thereafter.
OTHER PROJECTS
No work was undertaken at the Brooking (Western Australia) or Orapa Area F (Botswana) lamproite
and kimberlite exploration projects during the Quarter, in line with Lucapa’s focus on maximising
revenue generation at its operating mines as a primary objective and the more recent cash
preservation measures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
CORPORATE
During the Quarter, Lucapa successfully completed the raise of A$5.2m (before costs), via a nonrenounceable pro-rata rights issue (“Rights Issue”) (Refer ASX announcement 3 June 2020). The
Rights Issue involved the issue of 105.1m shares and 113.1m listed $0.10 options, expiring 2 years from
the date of issue (ASX: LOMOC). The Directors took up their full entitlements under the Rights Issue,
for which Far East Capital Limited acted as lead manager.
Proceeds from the Rights Issue will be used to advance the search for the primary kimberlite sources
of the high-value Lulo alluvial diamonds, preserve mining assets suspended as a result of the COVID19 pandemic and for general working capital purposes.
Significant overhead reductions continued during the Quarter at the Perth corporate office with
executive directors, other staff and contractors taking a voluntary 60% cut to emoluments or fees
until the end of the Quarter. The corporate staff level has been reduced and the non-executive
directors have continued to waive their non-executive director’s fees until further notice.
Lucapa’s cash balance was US$4.5m (A$6.5m) at Quarter end and Mothae held 784 carats in diamond
inventory. In addition, SML held a cash and receivables balance of US$3.5m as well as a 2,647 carat
diamond inventory at Quarter end.
Lucapa continues to explore refinancing solutions with a number of parties as well as existing
financiers. Lucapa will update the market as these are concluded.
During the Quarter, 250,000 $0.45 unlisted options exercisable on or before 24 May 2020, 2,250,000
$0.46 unlisted options exercisable on or before 31 May 2020 and 62,500 Performance Rights
exercisable on or before 31 May 2020 expired without exercise.
Subsequent to Quarter end, the Company allotted 10,431,284 fully paid ordinary shares pursuant to
Conversion Notices to Equigold Pte Ltd (“Equigold”) in respect of the quarterly interest and fees due
in accordance with the terms of the Equigold loan facility (Refer ASX announcement 9 October 2017).
Since inception, the outstanding principal has been reduced from US$15.0m to US$6.3m. This share
issue increased Equigold’s percentage ownership in the Company from 6.5% to 8.1%.
On 26 June 2020, the Company notified shareholders that it is convening its Annual General Meeting
(“Meeting”) to be held at The Celtic Club, 48 Ord Street, West Perth, Western Australia on Thursday,
30 July 2020 at 11 am (WST).
