BREAKTHROUGH RESULTS FROM NOVA JV DRILLING
HIGHLIGHTS


Follow-up RC drilling at Barking Gecko on EPL3669 intersects zones of thick
uranium mineralisation in basement targets



Best intersections include:
-

TN236RC:

2m at 385ppm eU3O8 from 32m,
10m at 326ppm eU3O8 from 63m,
24m at 297ppm eU3O8 from 139m; and
8m at 216ppm eU3O8 from 164m

-

TN237RC:

10m at 305ppm eU3O8 from 64m,
2m at 339ppm eU3O8 from 113m



Results to date have substantially upgraded the prospectivity for alaskite-type
basement deposits similar to the Rössing and Husab uranium orebodies, at the
4km by 1km Barking Gecko prospect
-



Through successful exploration, results have highlighted that the Barking Gecko
prospect could be part of a larger mineralised system, which include basementrelated deposits in the adjacent 100% owned Reptile Project, defining a distinct
18km zone of very high uranium prospectivity

Completion of the drilling program and data evaluation expected by the end of
July

Deep Yellow Limited (Deep Yellow) is pleased to advise that exploration drilling at the Barking
Gecko prospect (EPL3669) has encountered encouraging uranium mineralisation.
Barking Gecko is part of the Nova Joint Venture project (NJV) in Namibia. JOGMEC is earning
a 39.5% interest in the NJV through expenditure of A$4.5M within 4 years from the end 2016.
Upon completion of the earn-in, the joint venture parties will hold the following equity positions
- 39.5% Deep Yellow, 39.5% Joint Venture agreement with Japan Oil Gas and Metals National
Corporation (JOGMEC), 15% Toro Energy Limited and 6% Sixzone Investments (Pty) Ltd.
As announced in the March Quarterly Report, exploration drilling completed during 2019 on
the NJV identified consistent, but narrow (circa 1 to 2m thick), mineralised intersections over
a broad area, in a number of sub-vertical alaskite sheets intruding basement rocks. This
exploration campaign successfully defined a zone of interest approximately 4km long and 1km
wide, in a geologically favourable setting wrapping around a prominent domal feature. This
target zone is referred to as Barking Gecko (see figure 1) and is the focus of the current drilling
program.

For personal use only

In April 2020, JOGMEC agreed to proceed with a budget of A$392,300 to fulfill the balance of
its A$4.5M earn-in obligation. This five-month program concentrates primarily on Barking
Gecko, with some preparatory groundwork included for defining specific sites for follow-up
drilling. It was also agreed that any continued JV activity beyond this earn-in phase would be
based on the results achieved from the NJV, after which all the JV partners would be presented
with the overall project status to decide whether to contribute or dilute.
A 2,000m RC drilling program commenced at Barking Gecko on 12 June, focused on further
testing of this large anomaly, on three regional lines spaced 1 to 1.2km apart with holes spaced
at 200m. The objective was to determine whether the extensive, but isolated uranium
mineralisation could manifest into intersections of much greater thickness and frequency to
signify the possible presence of a Rössing or Husab style deposit.
Seven holes had been completed by 1 July for a total of 1,237m of the 2,000m program.
Drilling is ongoing. Figure 2 shows the Barking Gecko exploration target, drill hole locations
and geology.

Barking Gecko
In preparation for the drill campaign at Barking Gecko, a 3D inversion of high resolution
airborne magnetic data was completed and successfully delineated a zone of easterly
trending, remnant magnetism considered to define the prospective zone. Figure 3 outlines the
drill hole locations with respect to the first vertical derivative airborne magnetic image. Field
work during January to May concentrated on geological mapping, with a view to determining
the orientation of alaskite dykes to optimise siting of RC drill holes.
Section 479,300mE consisting of seven holes was completed by 1 July. The location of these
holes is outlined in figures 1 and 2 and cross-sectional views in figures 3 and 4. Importantly,
all holes on this line intersected mineralisation as indicated in figure 1, with grades and
thicknesses improving to the north. The best intersections to date have been obtained in hole
TN236RC which returned a cumulative downhole thickness of 44m with a maximum grade of
736ppm eU3O8 over 1m. Within this zone is 24m averaging 297ppm eU 3O8.
The mineralised intersections correspond to steeply south-dipping alaskite (leucogranite)
dykes intruding marble and biotite gneiss.
In-house portable XRF (pXRF) assaying showed that the very high grade eU3O8 intersections
of 2m at 754ppm in TN233RC (Figure 4) and 7m at 1,115ppm in TN235RC (Figures 4 and 5)
are partly due to thorium enrichment. The corrected intersections are 2m of 309ppm and 7m
at 415ppm U3O8 respectively. The thorium association in these two holes proved to be an
exception, as all other intersections are uranium-dominated. Table 3 in Appendix 1 shows the
uranium and thorium pXRF derived assays associated with the mineralised intersections and
these compare well with the downhole gamma derived eU3O8 values shown in figure 5 and
Table 2 in Appendix 1.
The mineralised drill hole intersections above the 100ppm eU3O8 over 1m cut-off are tabulated
in Table 1, Appendix 1. All RC drill hole locations are listed in Table 2, Appendix 1. PXRF
assay results are listed in Table 3.
Conclusion
The exploration results from the first seven holes of the ongoing drill campaign on the NJV
Barking Gecko Prospect are very encouraging. The 200m wide drill spacing leaves the
mineralisation intersected open both laterally and at depth, allowing ample space to identify
further mineralisation of significant size.
The discovery of notably thicker uranium intersections from this drilling campaign is of great
significance for Deep Yellow, as the Company holds a highly underexplored grouping of three
basement-related deposits (Ongolo, MS7 and Inca), that occur 10km to 18km to the
East/North East of the Barking Gecko discovery in its adjacent EPL3496. These deposits
occur on the 100% owned Reptile Project containing 45.1Mlb grading 420ppm U 3O8. See
Appendix 2.
When combining these underexplored deposits and associated exploration targets, the
significant potential of Barking Gecko is evident. It is becoming clear to the Company that a
large mineralising system is present and there is a distinct opportunity to substantially improve
on the basement-related uranium resources already identified within this highly-prospective
area that can be defined within a 10km radius.
The upside potential at Barking Gecko is in addition to the palaeochannel-related deposits and
targets that also occur on the Reptile Project (EPLs 3496 and 3497) where the Tumas PreFeasibility Study is currently undergoing completion and where the Company has stated
exploration targets exist that are considered able to increase the existing palaeochannel
resource base by 30% to 125Mlb to 150Mlb in the 300 to 500ppm U3O8 grade range.

With regard to the alaskite-type basement targets, the combination of EPL3669 (part of the
NJV project) and the adjacent EPL3496 (100% owned Reptile Project), forms a highly
prospective land package that has already delivered substantial uranium resources. The
exploration results from the first seven holes of the drilling campaign at Barking Gecko reaffirm
management's positive expectation for additional discoveries on these projects.

Sampling techniques

 Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement
tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments,
etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the
broad meaning of sampling.
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.
 In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this
would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling
was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases, more explanation may be required, such as where
there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems.
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.



The current drilling relies on down hole gamma data from calibrated probes
which were converted into equivalent uranium values (eU3O8) by experienced
DYL personnel and will be confirmed by a competent person (geophysicist).
Appropriate factors were applied to all downhole gamma counting results to
make allowance for drill rod thickness, gamma probe dead times and
incorporating all other applicable calibration factors.

33mm Auslog total gamma probes were used and operated by company
personnel.
Gamma probes were calibrated at Pelindaba, South Africa, in May 2007 and in
December 2007.
Between 2008 and 2013 sensitivity checks were conducted by periodic relogging of a test hole (Hole-ALAD1480) to confirm operation.
Auslog probes were again re-calibrated at the calibration pit located at Langer
Heinrich Mine site in December 2014, May 2015, August 2017, July 2018 and
September 2019.
During the drilling, the probes were checked daily against a standard source.
Gamma measurements were taken at 5cm intervals at a logging speed of
approximately 2m per minute.
Probing was done immediately after drilling mainly through the drill rods and in
some cases in the open holes. Rod factors have been established once
sufficient in-rod and open-hole data were available to compensate for the
reduced gamma counts when logging was done through the drill rods. No

correction for water was done. The majority of drill holes were dry.
All gamma measurements were corrected for dead time which is unique to the
probe.
All corrected (dead time and rod factor) gamma values were converted to
equivalent eU3O8 values over the same intervals using the probe-specific Kfactor.

Chemical assay data

 Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails,
face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and
if so, by what method, etc).
 Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample
recoveries and results assessed.
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.
 Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and
grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.
 Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and

Geochemical samples were derived from Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling at
intervals of 1 m. Samples were split at the drill site using a riffle splitter to obtain
a 0.5kg sample of which an approximately 90 g subsample will be obtained for
portable XRF-analysis at RMR's in-house laboratory.




RC drilling was used for the Nova JV drilling program.
All holes are drilled at an angle of 70 degrees and intersections are reported as
downhole not true thicknesses.




Drill chip recoveries are good at around 90%.
Drill chip recoveries were assessed by weighing 1m drill chip samples at the
drill site. Weights were recorded in sample tag books.
Sample loss was minimised by placing the sample bags directly underneath
cyclone/splitter.



All drill holes were geologically logged.
The logging was semi-quantitative in nature. The lithology type as well as
subtypes were determined for all samples.
Other parameters routinely logged included colour, colour intensity, weathering,
grain size and total gamma count (by handheld Rad-Eye scintillometer).

Commentary



A rig-mounted 75:25 riffle splitter was used to treat a full 1m sample from the
cyclone. The sample was further split using a 50:50 riffle splitter to obtain a
0.5kg sample. No field duplicates were taken. Most sampling was dry.
The above sub-sampling techniques are common industry practice and
appropriate.
Sample sizes are considered appropriate to the grain size of the material being
sampled.





Downhole gamma tools were used as explained under ‘Sampling techniques’.
This is the principal evaluating technique.



Standards and blank samples are inserted during portable XRF analysis at an
approximate rate of one each for every 20 samples which is compatible with
industry norm.



Geology was directly recorded into a tablet in the field and sample tag books
filled in at the drill site.
The drill data of those logs and tag books (lithology, sample specifications etc.)
were transferred by designated personnel into a geological database.
Equivalent eU3O8 values have previously been and were for the current
program calculated from raw gamma files by applying calibration factors and
casing factors where applicable.
The adjustment factors were stored in the database.

 The measures taken to ensure sample security.



1m RC drill chip samples were prepared at the drill site. The samples are stored
in plastic bags. Sample tags were placed inside the bags. The samples were
placed into plastic crates and transported from the drill site to RMR’s site
premises in Swakopmund by Company personnel for analysis by portable XRF.
Upon completion of the assay work the remainder of the drill chip sample bags
for each hole will be packed back into crates and then stored in designated
containers in chronological order, locked up and kept safe at RMR’s dedicated
sample storage yard at Rocky Point located outside Swakopmund.

 A summary of all information material to the
understanding of the exploration results including a
tabulation of the following information for all Material
drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above
sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
 If the exclusion of this information is justified on the
basis that the information is not Material and this
exclusion does not detract from the understanding of
the report, the Competent Person should clearly
explain why this is the case.
 In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade
truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off
grades are usually Material and should be stated.

Alaskite type uranium mineralisation occurs on the Nova JV ground and is the
main target of the current drilling program. It is associated with sheeted
leucogranite intrusions into the basement rocks of the Damara orogen.
Palaeochannel type mineralisation occurs as secondary carnotite enrichment
of variably calcretised palaeochannel and sheet wash sediments and adjacent
weathered bedrock. Uranium mineralisation is surficial, strata-bound and
hosted by Cenozoic and possibly Tertiary sediments, which include from top to
bottom scree sand, gypcrete, and calcareous (calcretised) as well as noncalcareous sand, grit and conglomerate.



7 RC holes for a total of 1,237m, which are the subject of this announcement,
have been drilled in the current program up to the 1st July 2020.
 All holes were drilled angled 70 degree to the north, and intersections measured
do not present true thicknesses.
 Table 2 in Appendix 1 lists all the drill hole locations. Table 1 lists the results of
intersections greater than 100ppm eU3O8 over 1m. Table 3 lists the in house
portable XRF analysis of anomalous intersections.

 5cm intervals of down-hole gamma counts per second (cps) logged inside the
drill rods were composited to 1m down hole intervals showing greater than
100cps values over 1m.

Commentary

 Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths
of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade
results, the procedure used for such aggregation
should be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
 The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.
 These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
 If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to
the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be
reported.
 If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this
effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).
 Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole
collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
 Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of
both low and high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.
 Other exploration data, if meaningful and material,
should be reported including (but not limited to):
geological observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.

 No grade truncations were applied.

 The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g.
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or

 Further exploration drilling work is planned on EPL3669 for both alaskite and
palaeochannel targets that reported positive results.

 Alaskite type mineralisation is vertical to steeply dipping in nature. The
intersections of this exploration drilling program do not represent true width
and each intersection must be evaluated in accordance with its structural
setting.
 Palaeochannel type mineralisation is sub-horizontal and all drilling vertical,
therefore, mineralised intercepts are considered to represent true widths.
 Appendix 1 (Table 2) shows all drill hole locations.
 Maps and sections are included in the text.

 Comprehensive reporting of all exploration results is practised and will be
finalised on the completion of the drilling program.

 The wider area was subject to extensive drilling in the 1970s and 1980s by
Anglo American Prospecting Services, Falconbridge and General Mining.
