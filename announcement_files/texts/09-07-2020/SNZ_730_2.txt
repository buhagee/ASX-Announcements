2Q20 METRICS – SALES OF OCCUPATION RIGHTS
Summerset Group reports 123 sales for the quarter ending 30 June 2020, comprising 58 new
sales and 65 resales.
The quarter included four weeks of COVID-19 level four lockdown with prospective residents
unable to visit our villages and property settlements suspended. To ensure the safety of
residents, visitor restrictions were also in place throughout levels three and two.
Summerset CEO Julian Cook said, “Through the level four lockdown period sales and
settlements of occupation rights largely ceased. This had a significant impact on the business.”
“However, sales and settlements have largely recovered and we are seeing sales enquiry and
sales rates marginally stronger than is typical for this time of year,” said Mr Cook.
Total new sales stock levels have remained at a normal level relative to 31 December 2019.
Resale stock numbers were slightly higher due to delays with refurbishments and people moving
out under alert levels 4 and 3; however, numbers are expected to reduce over the next six
months.
Immediately prior to the lockdown Summerset’s Casebrook village main building in Christchurch
opened. Currently more than 50% of its serviced apartments and memory care apartments have
sold. There have also been strong pre-sales for Summerset’s newest village in Bell Block, New
Plymouth.
There have not been any cases of COVID-19 across Summerset village residents or staff to
date.

NOTES:

•

Quarterly metrics on occupation right sales are provided by the 10th of the month following the end of each
quarter.
Occupation right sales volumes represent the number of occupation rights settled in the period and differ from
retirement unit deliveries which represents the number of new homes for which construction was completed in the
period.
The quarterly sales metrics provided may not necessarily reflect NZ IFRS financial performance for the
corresponding period. In particular, key items in the income statement, such as the fair value movement of
investment property, are dependent on several variables, of which one is occupation right sales. NZ IFRS
financial performance is calculated for the periods ending 30 June and 31 December each year.
