Pure Foods Tasmania Limited (ASX:PFT) TRADING UPDATE
9 July 2020
Woodbridge Smoke House (WBSH), a 100% subsidiary of Pure Foods Tasmania Ltd (ASX:PFT), has seen
increased interest from both new and existing customers in its Smoked seafood products with annual
volume expected to increase by approx 25% for FY2021, representing approximately 5% of PFT’s
annual group revenue.
We are regularly seeing WBSH being chosen over our competitors due to WBSH’s ‘standout flavour
and texture’ as commented by a recent new customer.
Michael Cooper MD commented “this supports our strong view that our traditional ‘brining and
smoking’ over timber sourced from the Woodbridge region in Southern Tasmania delivers a unique
flavour unmatched by any other”.
Tasmanian Pate also continues to trade well, with revenue (based on unaudited management
accounts) up 24% to the end of May 2020 compared to the end of May 2019 and the new factory
running very well with increased quality and efficiencies achieved.
As per our advice pre–listing, PFT is well advanced with its automation project and new product
development continues to be a core focus for the Group and current initiatives include new look
packaging increasing presentation and recyclability.
We also have had no impact to our operations or supply chain due to COVID-19.
