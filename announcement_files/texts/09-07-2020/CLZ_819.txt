INTRODUCTION

WA-focused gold exploration and development company Classic Minerals Limited (ASX. CLZ) ("Classic", or "the
Company") is pleased to announce that it has received assays results from its most recent RC drilling program at its
Forrestania Gold Project (FGP) in Western Australia. The Company completed a total of 21 holes for 1,304m at
the Kat Gap project which is a continuation of the infill and extensional drilling program interrupted by the onset of
COVID-19.
RC drilling at Kat Gap continued to deliver significant zones of gold mineralisation located on the granitegreenstone contact. Recent drilling at Kat Gap also showed that very high-grade gold occurs west of the main granite
– greenstone contact lodes well out into the granite. Kat Gap is strategically located approximately 70km south-south
east of the Company’s Forrestania Gold project containing the Lady Magdalene and Lady Ada gold resources.

Classic CEO Dean Goodwin said:
This new very high-grade intersection out into the granite is an exciting development for the Kat Gap Project.
We decided to extend some of our planned drill holes west of our current drill pattern to see if further gold
lodes were lurking out in the granite. We were right. Now we just have to work out what orientation this new
lode is running at. We had a feeling something was out there as we had a handful of old historical drill holes
along strike that had a few lower grade sniffs out in the granite. This new intersection really bodes well for
our future drilling programs that will be conducted out in the granite following up the historical auger
geochemical anomalies.
We also started a program of infill drilling north of the Proterozoic dyke in readiness for future open pit
optimisation studies. Existing RC drilling is a little far apart to get meaningful data, so we need to infill drill
for about 400m of strike. These new results are only the start of that extensive program with many more
results to come over the next few months.
We will also be conducting extensional RC drilling to the north and south of our current drill pattern. This
should hopefully see the deposit grow another 200m or so.

DRILLING COMPLETED AT KAT GAP

Classic drilled a total of 21 RC holes for 1,304m at Kat Gap and is pleased to confirm that most holes returned gold
mineralisation striking in a northwest-southeast direction. The infill drilling has confirmed continuity of
mineralised zones within the current inferred resource model north of the Proterozoic dyke.
Mineralisation remains open in all directions.
This round of RC drilling is a continuation of the infill and extensional RC drilling program undertaken prior to the
onset of COVID 19. Drilling was primarily focused on testing the main granite-greenstone contact up to 100m north
of the Proterozoic dyke.
The drilling also encompassed extending several RC holes at depth to test an area west of our current drilling pattern
for high grade gold out in the granite.
Drill hole FKGRC184 extended further out into the granite than the rest of the RC holes some 30-35m from the main
contact lodes west of Classic’s existing drilling. Very high-grade gold was intersected near the end of the hole
comprising smokey grey quartz veining and biotite alteration. The interval contained abundant visible gold
together with disseminated pyrite and molybdenite (see figure 2.0). Further drilling is required at depth and along
strike from this newly discovered zone. Best result from this hole was:

•

4m @ 76.72g/t Au from 79m including 1m @ 304g/t Au from 82m.

PREVIOUS RC DRILLING AT KAT GAP BY CLASSIC

Classic has completed 10 separate drilling campaigns at Kat Gap prior to the most recent RC drilling program. A total
of 174 holes for 13,074m was completed between M ay 2018 and March 2020 all returning significant high-grade
gold intercepts. The majority of the drilling is relatively shallow, down to approximately 70m vertical depth below
surface and covered a strike length of the granite – greenstone contact of approximately 500m. The main area of
drilling has been focused primarily on and adjacent to both contacts of a cross-cutting Proterozoic dyke where it
intersects the main granite-greenstone contact. At this location the gold mineralisation has been significantly enriched.

FUTURE DRILLING PLANNED FOR KAT GAP

The next few rounds of RC drilling at Kat Gap will focus mainly on infill testing the main granite – greenstone contact
north of the Proterozoic dyke for a strike length of some 400m. This work will assist engineers in conducting more
accurate open pit optimization studies prior to future mining operations.
Further RC drilling will also test the northerly and southerly extensions for another 100-200m along strike. RC Drilling
will also test the extent of the recently discovered supergene horizon south of the Proterozoic dyke out in the granite.
Further drilling will be conducted to determine the source of this new supergene zone.
RC drilling programs will also be carried out in the granite to test the large 5 km long geochemical anomaly identified
in previous historical auger soil sampling. The initial program will focus around the cross-cutting Proterozoic dyke
where high auger values were returned along with a dilational site located in the north-eastern most area of the
geochemical anomaly.
Historical RC drilling at Kat Gap is mostly on 100m – 200m line spacings. There is strong potential for additional
mineralisation to be identified up-dip, down-dip and along strike, both outside of and within the existing historical RC
drill coverage.
Classic is continuing its follow up RC drilling campaign.

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry
standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments,
etc). These examples should not be taken as
limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation
that are Material to the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has
been done this would be relatively simple (eg
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1
m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to
produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases more explanation may be required, such
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules)
may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic,
etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or
standard tube, depth of diamond tails, facesampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).

• Method of recording and assessing core and
chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery
and ensure representative nature of the
samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample
recovery and grade and whether sample bias
may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain
of fine/coarse material.

Commentary
• The samples were taken by a RC face
sampling hammer drill. All RC holes
were sampled at one-metre intervals.
• Care was taken to control metre
delineation, and loss of fines.
• The determination of mineralisation
was done via industry standard
methods, including RC drilling, followed
by splitting, crushing and fire assaying

• All drilling was completed using reverse
circulation method and diamond core,
using a multipurpose Hydco 450 model
rig and 6m Remet Harlsen 4 ½ inch rods.
The rig mounted Airtruck has 1150 cfm
500 psi auxiliary couples with a
hurricane 7t Booster 2400 cfm /1000 psi
booster. Core size was NQ and HQ using
standard tube.
• Recoveries from the drilling are not
known, as sample weights were not
recorded at this stage of exploration,
but visual inspection of samples in the
field indicate that recoveries were
sufficient.
• The shroud tolerance was monitored,
and metre delineation was kept in
check. Loss of fines was controlled
through mist injection.
• It is not clear whether a relationship
between recovery and grade occurs as
recovery data was not collected (e.g.
bag weights).

• Whether core and chip samples have been
geologically and geotechnically logged to a level
of detail to support appropriate Mineral
Resource estimation, mining studies and
metallurgical studies.
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in
nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc)
photography.
• The total length and percentage of the relevant
intersections logged.
• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether
quarter, half or all core taken.
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled,
rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or
dry.
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and
appropriateness of the sample preparation
technique.
• Quality control procedures adopted for all subsampling stages to maximise representivity of
samples.
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is
representative of the in situ material collected,
including for instance results for field
duplicate/second-half sampling.
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the
grain size of the material being sampled.
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the
assaying and laboratory procedures used and
whether the technique is considered partial or
total.
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld
XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in
determining the analysis including instrument
make and model, reading times, calibrations
factors applied and their derivation, etc.
• Nature of quality control procedures adopted
(eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external
laboratory checks) and whether acceptable
levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision
have been established.
• The verification of significant intersections by
either independent or alternative company
personnel.
• The use of twinned holes.
• Documentation of primary data, data entry
procedures, data verification, data storage
(physical and electronic) protocols.
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data.

•

•
•

Core and chips were logged to a level of
detail to support the Mineral Resource
estimation.
Logging was qualitative in nature.
All intersections were logged

• The nature and quality of the sampling
suits the purpose, being exploration.
The laboratory preparation is standard
practice and has not been further
refined to match the ore.
• QC in the lab prep stage was limited to
taking pulp duplicates (e.g. no coarse
crush duplicates were submitted)
• The sample split sizes (4-5 kg are
regarded as more than adequate for
the nature and type of material
sampled.
• Diamond core was cut and half core
sent for analysis.

• Standard 50g fire assays with an AAS
finish were used to get assay results.
This is a total technique, and
considered appropriate for this level of
exploration.
• Quality control was carried out by
inserting blanks and standards into the
sampling chain and 5% intervals. These
all showed acceptable levels of
accuracy and precision.

• Significant intersections have not been
validated by independent or alternative
personnel.
• No twin holes were included in this
programme, as it is not relevant to the
stage of exploration and purpose of this
drilling.
• All primary data was collected on
spread sheets which have been
validated for errors and included into
an Access database.
• Assay data has not been adjusted

used in Mineral Resource estimation.
• Specification of the grid system used.
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control.
• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration

Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation
procedure(s) and classifications applied.
• Whether sample compositing has been applied.
• Whether the orientation of sampling achieves
unbiased sampling of possible structures and
the extent to which this is known, considering
the deposit type.
• If the relationship between the drilling
orientation and the orientation of key
mineralised structures is considered to have
introduced a sampling bias, this should be
assessed and reported if material.
• The measures taken to ensure sample security.

• The results of any audits or reviews of sampling
techniques and data

• Drill hole locations were determined by
GPS in the field in UTM zone 50.
• Topographic control is available
through a detailed satellite-derived
DTM.
• Holes were not drilled on a pattern and
there was no specific drill hole spacing.
In general holes are drilled within 50m
from previous intersections.
• The data spacing is considered sufficient
to demonstrate geological and grade
continuity for estimation procedures.
• Samples were not composited.
• The orientation of sampling has
achieved unbiased sampling of
structures, with drilling perpendicular
to the dip and strike of the mineralised
zones
• The relationship between the drilling
orientation and the orientation of key
mineralised structures is not considered
to have introduced a sampling bias.
• Samples were immediately dispatched
to the laboratory and have at all times
been in possession of CLM or its
designated contractors. Chain of custody
was maintained throughout.
• No audits of any of the data have been
carried out.

gold rights on the FGP tenements
including but not limited to nickel,
lithium and other metals
The acquisition includes 80% of the
gold rights (other mineral rights
retained by tenement holder) in the
following granted tenements:
E77/2207; E77/2219; E77/2239;
P77/4290; P77/4291; E77/2303;
E77/2220.
Lady Lila is situated upon 100% owned
CLZ tenements P77/4325 and
P77/4326 (details in announcement
dated 21 March 2017)
Kat Gap is situated upon E74/467, held
by Sulphide Resources Pty Ltd. CLZ
acquired 100% of these tenements in
January 2019 (details in
announcement dated 9th Jan 2019)
All exploration was carried out by
previous owners of the tenements
(Aztec Mining, Forrestania Gold NL,
Viceroy Australia, Sons of Gwalia,
Sulphide Resources Pty Ltd)
The deposit is a Archean shear-zone
hosted gold deposit.
Geological interpretation indicates
that the general stratigraphy consists
of metasediments, BIF’s and cherts to
the east of the tenement, overlying an
older sequence of metamorphosed
komatiitic and high-magnesian basalts
to the west. Black shales/pelites occur
as small interbedded units throughout
the stratigraphy, which dips gently to
the east (10-35°) and strikes N-S,
bending in a NNW direction in the far
north of the tenement.
An Archaean-aged quartz dolerite unit
(informally the ‘Wattle Rocks Dolerite’)
is emplaced along a contact between
high-MgO basalt to the west and lowMgO ultramafic to the east, in the
western part of the tenement and is
the host rock for the Lady Ada (and
Lady Magdalene) mineralisation.
Strongly magnetic Proterozoic dolerite
dykes cross-cut the stratigraphy in an
east-west direction, splaying to the
ENE, following fault directions
interpreted from the aeromagnetics. A
number of narrow shear zones lie
subparallel to the shallow-dipping

Drill hole
Information

Page 20 of 21

• A summary of all information material to the
understanding of the exploration results
including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill
hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level –
elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception
depth
o hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on
the basis that the information is not Material and
this exclusion does not detract from the

metasediment-mafic contact within
the host stratigraphy and are
important sites and conduits for the
observed mineralisation. The Sapphire
shear zone strikes approximately ENE,
dipping to the SE at about 25°, and
appears to crosscut all lithologies. This
shear zone and associated shears host
the bulk of the gold mineralisation at
Wattle Rocks. Similar flat-dipping
shears are known to crosscut the Lady
Magdalene area. Approximately 8-12
metres of transported sands and a
gold depleted weathering profile of
saprolitic clays overly the Lady Ada and
Lady Magdalene mineralisation.
• Structurally, the Wattle Rocks area is
quite complex and is positioned near
the intersection of several major
breakages and flexures in the regional
stratigraphy in this part of the
Forrestania Greenstone belt.
Numerous shear zones are evident
throughout the area, particularly at
changes of rock stratigraphy where
there are rheological differences.
Narrow, stacked, flat-dipping shear
zones are evident within the quartz
dolerite unit and may have resulted
from thrusting of the younger
sedimentary sequence over the mafic
package from east to west. A similar
model is predicted for Van Uden (10
km northwards) where mineralised
quartz veins appear to ‘stack’ through
a host ferruginous metasediment.

attached tables

understanding of the report, the Competent
Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting
averaging techniques, maximum and/or
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material
and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short
lengths of high grade results and longer lengths
of low grade results, the procedure used for such
aggregation should be stated and some typical
examples of such aggregations should be shown
in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.
These relationships are particularly important in
the reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect
to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should
be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths
are reported, there should be a clear statement
to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width
not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for
any significant discovery being reported These
should include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and appropriate
sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and high
grades and/or widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including (but not
limited to): geological observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or
large-scale step-out drilling).
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of
possible extensions, including the main geological
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided
this information is not commercially sensitive.

• High grades were not cut in the
reporting of weighted averages in this
Report.
• Summary drill hole results as reported
in figures and in the appendix 2 to this
Report are reported on a 2m internal
dilution and 0.5 g/t Au cuto-off.

• In almost all cases, the drill holes are
perpendicular to the mineralisation.
The true width is not expected to
deviate much from intersection width.

• Appropriate images have been
provided in the Report.

• Figures represent specific selected drill
intervals to demonstrate the general
trend of high grade trends. Cross
sections show all relevant result in a
balanced way.
• No other relevant data is reported

• Further RC drilling is being considered.
• Figures clearly demonstrate the areas
of possible extensions
