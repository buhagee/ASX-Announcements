•

The Crown Mountain Bankable Feasibility Study (‘BFS’) has delivered robust economic
outcomes including a pre-tax NPV(10) of US$376m and IRR of 36.4% , assuming purchase of
the mobile equipment, workshops and ancillary infrastructure
The BFS reaffirms that Crown Mountain represents a compelling high quality coking coal
opportunity for development with a competitive operating and capital cost structure and
access to existing common user rail and port infrastructure
The mine would produce high quality low volatile (‘LV’) metallurgical coal, with the Life of
Mine (‘LOM’) product mix being 86% Hard Coking Coal (‘HCC’) and 14% Pulverised Coal
Injection (‘PCI’) coal
The mine plan is based on an average LOM production rate of 1.7 Mtpa of saleable coal,
57.5 Mt Total Run of Mine (‘ROM’) from the North, East and South pits over 15 years
The Bankable Feasibility Study has also identified a number of areas of potential
optimisation that the Company intends to assess in order to maximise the economic
outcomes whilst finalising the Environmental Assessment (‘EA’) approval that is on track
with the EA application to be submitted in March Quarter 2021
The BFS reflects a 15 year LOM with future potential to increase reserves through the
conversion of the existing inferred resource1, excluded from the BFS, with additional
exploration and quality test work in the Southern extension
The confirmed coal quality outlined in the BFS also provides a basis for discussions with
potential end user customers for the sale of coal produced by the Crown Mountain Hard
Coking Coal Project.

Jameson Resources Limited (‘Jameson’ or the ‘Company’) is pleased to advise of the Bankable Feasibility
Study2 results for the Crown Mountain Hard Coking Coal Project in South East British Columbia, Canada. The
Crown Mountain Project is owned by Jameson’s Canadian Subsidiary NWP Coal Canada Ltd that is 78%
owned by Jameson and 22% by Bathurst Resources Limited (ASX:BRL).
The BFS demonstrates robust economics of the Crown Mountain Hard Coking Coal Project with a low strip
ratio, 1.7Mtpa clean coal product operation at competitive operating costs to global seaborne markets
through one of the three deep water ports on the west coast of British Columbia.
The BFS has demonstrated a technically and economically robust project that will produce an average of
86% LV HCC and 14% PCI coal over the 15-year mine life (see Table 1). The study was led by Stantec
Consulting’s (‘Stantec’) Vancouver office with other consultants engaged including Sedgman Canada Limited
(‘Sedgman’) (a member of CIMIC Group), and SRK Consulting (‘SRK’).

The Company cautions that there can be no certainty that further exploration and coal quality test work will result in any inferred mineral
resources being upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources or that an extension to the ROM tonnes itself will be realised
2

Whist the BFS has been completed to an accuracy level of +/-15% , upon successful receipt of the Environmental Assessment Certificate
and Mining Permit, conditions of these permits will be incorporated into the mining plan that may result in associated economic impacts as
a result.

LOCATION
Crown Mountain is located in the Elk Valley coalfields of the East Kootenays in the South East of British
Columbia, where there are currently four operating metallurgical coal mines that are operated by Teck
Resources Limited. Crown Mountain is situated between Teck’s Line Creek and Elkview operations, and
displays similar geology and coal quality. Given the Project’s proximity to existing operations that produce
approximately 26Mt of coal annually, there are a number of infrastructure benefits that makes development
enticing that include:
•
•

•

•

Close proximity to Canadian Pacific’s common user rail that links the coalfields of the Elk Valley to the
deep-water ports of Western British Columbia
Three potential deep-water ports that allow access to the seaborne metallurgical coal market –
Westshore, Neptune and Ridley Terminals. Westshore is the preferred port, and while the Company
does not currently have a take or pay agreement in place, publicly available information indicates Teck
Resources will be shifting the majority of its production from Westshore to Neptune Terminal once that
expansion is complete and Teck’s take or pay contract expires with Westshore in 2021
Availability of a skilled labour force without the requirements of having to build camp infrastructure,
with the towns of Sparwood, Elkford, Cranbrook and Fernie all having skilled labour pools with mining
experience to potentially source future workers
Excellent OEM vendor support, in the Elk Valley, with a number of major equipment suppliers having
local warehouses, maintenance facilities, and personnel to provide operational maintenance support.

Jameson originally completed a Pre Feasibility Study (‘PFS’) in 2014 and subsequently updated the PFS in
2017 when market conditions had changed. In 2017 the Premium LV HCC Benchmark had spent the 18
months prior at an average of ~US$120/t, and had been as low as US$73.40/t. Since that time, the Premium
LV HCC Benchmark has averaged ~US$184/t, and has been as high as US$314/t.

ECONOMICS
The BFS was undertaken in the 2018-2020 period where benchmark prices were high resulting in upward
cost base pressures and the incentive to bring on additional marginal tonnes of HCC to market. In the period
between 2016 and 2019 the average all-in sustaining cost (‘AISC’) of a tonne of metallurgical coal produced
in South East British Columbia and sold on the seaborne market increased by more than 30% (see Graph 1).
Graph 1

All coal extraction is undertaken via open pit mining of the North, East and South pits. The BFS assumes a
ROM coal production of 57.5Mt at an average LOM ROM strip ratio of 4.7:1 BCM:ROM tonnes. The first
four years of mining occurs in the North and East pits which is lower ROM strip ratio of 4.1 BCM:ROM
tonnes and higher yield (61.2%), producing up to 2.3 Mtpa. The mine then progresses to the South Pit
which is mined from the South to the North.

Coal processing occurs through a Coal Handling and Process Plant (‘CHPP’) that is located near the North Pit.
Coal will be trucked to the CHPP where it will be processed. The average LOM processing yield is 48.7%,
delivering a clean coal, or saleable coal resource of 26.3Mt at an average clean coal strip ratio of 10.3:1
BCM:t clean coal. The processed coal will then be conveyed ~3km down to a Truck Loadout Bin where the
coal is then trucked 15 kms to a clean coal stockpile and reclaimed into the Train Loadout Facility. Coal is
then loaded onto Canadian Pacific rail cars at the proposed figure eight Rail Load Out. Coal will then be
railed approximately 1,200 km to the preferred Westshore Terminal for global export.
The key mining assumptions are summarised in Table 3 below.

The average LOM long term benchmark Premium LV HCC was assessed to be US$164/tonne which is the
five-year historic average. It is expected that the North and East pits achieve the benchmark price, while the
South Pit HCC receives a 10% discount to the benchmark price. The CSR and Volatile Matter of the HCC from
the North (and East) and South Pits is included in Graph 2 below. The CAD:USD exchange rate is assumed to
be 0.75 over the LOM.
Graph 2

The Crown Mountain PCI (average 14% of saleable coal over the Project) is a Low to Mid Volatile PCI coal
that compares favourably with the Australian Low to Mid Volatile PCI coals on the basis of ash, sulphur,
carbon content and calorific value which are the key determinants in coke replacement ratio. The Crown
Mountain PCI coal’s coke replacement ratio is similar to that achieved by the LV PCI coals produced in

Australia. North and East pits PCI coal is assumed to achieve US$115/tonne, while the South Pit PCI coal
achieves a price of US$112/tonne.
The key economic outcomes are as follows, and summarised in Table 4 below:

Total Capital expenditure of US$351m (CA$468m) for owner operator option is approx. US$206/t annual
production, as depicted in Graph 3 below. A leasing scenario was assessed as part of the BFS to reduce the preproduction capital expenditure, by leasing major and minor mobile mining equipment, to approximately
US$279m (CA$372m) or US$164/t annual production, however increases operating costs. The reduced preproduction capital scenario has been included in Graph 3 to compare with the purchased equipment scenario
assumed as the BFS base case. Further analysis of the leasing scenario is included in Tables 17-19, however
leasing will be further assessed as a part of the BFS optimisation, together with contractor operated scenarios
when closer to an investment decision.

REGULATORY AND SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE
Jameson, and Jameson’s subsidiary NWP Coal Canada Ltd (‘NWP’) has been actively engaged in the
regulatory process since 2014 and during this time has engaged with both Provincial and Federal regulators,
First Nations and other stakeholders.
NWP has completed baseline studies and modelling that has enabled pre-submittal meetings with
Regulators to discuss the approach to the EA Application in order to address the requirements outlined in
the Application Information Requirements (‘AIR’) and prepare effects assessments that form a critical part
of the EA Application. NWP expects to submit the EA Application in the March Quarter 2021.
NWP is an active participant in the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Assessment Framework (EV CEMF). EV CMEF
is a joint initiative between the Province of British Columbia and Ktunaxa Nation Council to provide a
framework to assess the cumulative environmental effects of industry in the Elk Valley. This group consists
of government regulators, NGOs, other coal developers and other industries. The intent of the framework
is to provide a level playing field to assess the Crown Mountain Project’s potential impacts, with
consideration to other projects impacts, and will assist in developing offsets as part of the permitting
process.

OPTIMISATION OPPORTUNITIES
The finalisation of the BFS has identified areas of potential optimisation that will be assessed in order to
improve the overall execution and economics of the Crown Mountain Hard Coking Coal Project. The
potential optimisation activities include:
•

•

•

•

•

Increased utilisation of CHPP hours (BFS assumed parameters of 6,400 annual production run hours
whilst plant availability, after planned outages is 8,060 hours). Industry experience indicates that this
can be enhanced through improved scheduling of maintenance and downtime, should the mine plan
enable additional ROM tonnes to be made available.
Improved yield with production of higher ash product (10% or 10.5%) in line with other Canadian and
Australian HCC producers, thereby reducing washing sensitivities in the CHPP with expected
corresponding ash penalty of c.1.5% price discount for every 1% ash above 9.5% Ash benchmark, which
may enhance overall economics. Additional work is required to understand any potential implications
on coal quality measures as a result of a higher ash product.
Reduce CHPP capital costs by assessing either lower cost Chinese steel sourcing for the current design,
or alternately a modular pre-assembled plant design also incorporating lower cost steel supply but
reducing the potential impact on capital costs of anti-dumping tariff’s.
Contract mining or leasing mobile equipment, workshop, wash bays and associated facilities to reduce
upfront capital and mitigate the execution risk associated with bringing a new project into production,
which would likely result in increased operating costs due to the lease financing cost or contractor
margins but with the potential for initial productivity savings.
Build Own Operate Transfer for the CHPP and associated infrastructure, similar to the contract miner
scenario, whereby capital would be reduced at the expense of operating costs however allows for a
more appropriate transfer of risk to expert plant operators whilst in the commissioning and ramp up to
commercial production phase.

Crown Mountain also has the potential to add further Measured and Indicated resource tonnes if the
Southern Extension, that currently includes 24mt of Inferred Resource, was able to be successfully
converted to a Measured and Indicated resource.

RESOURCES AND RESERVES

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The results and underlying assumptions for the 2017 Updated PFS were reported to ASX on 26 April 2017 in
an ASX announcement entitled “PFS Update Yields Lower CAPEX and OPEX and Outstanding Financials,
Demonstrating the Significant Potential of Crown Mountain” and was further detailed in the 2017, 2018 and
2019 Annual Reports to Shareholders.
The 2017 Updated PFS was preceded by a 2014 PFS reported to ASX on 11 August 2014 in an ASX
announcement entitled “Prefeasibility study confirms Crown Mountain Hard Coking Coal Project will enjoy
outstanding economics” Preliminary Economic Assessment reported to ASX on 17 April 2013 in an ASX
announcement entitled “PEA Confirms Potential Robust Economics on Crown Mountain Coal Project” and
further detailed in the 2013 Jameson Annual Report. Updated coal quality results were reported to ASX on
14 March 2014 in an announcement entitled “Positive Property-Wide Coal Quality, Crown Mountain Coking
Coal Project”. Subsequent to this, coal quality results from the 2018 exploration program were reported in a
number of releases to ASX on 16 January 2019 entitled “Initial Coal Quality Testing Results”, 4 April 2019
entitled “Testing Confirms North Pit to be Hard Coking Coal”, 23 April 2019 entitled “Additional Testing
Confirms Hard Coking Coal”, 26 July 2019 entitled “Coke Testing Program Complete – Hard Coking Coal
Confirmed” and finally on 2 August 2019 an update to the announcement on 26 July 2019, entitled “Coke
Testing Program Complete – Announcement Updated”.

RESOURCES
The basis for the determination of the Resources is set out below. During the 2018 drilling program, NWP’s
exploration focus was on collecting coal quality and geotechnical information, and undertaking pilot scale
coke testing. In total, 33 holes were drilled on the Property with a cumulative total drilled meterage of 4,711
m. To collect core samples for coal quality testing, NWP drilled 26 holes with total drilled meterage of
3,610 m. Ten of these holes were drilled by reverse circulation as pilot holes, however one of the pilot holes
was abandoned due to poor drilling conditions. Sixteen drill holes were drilled with 150 mm (6-inch) coring
bits at nine different locations. Note, multiple drill holes were drilled on the same drilling pad in order to
collect bulk samples large enough for coal analysis. Only coal-bearing zones were cored.
The geophysical logs for the 33 new exploration drill holes were thoroughly reviewed and the provided
interpretation of the seam and rock band thicknesses and depths were verified. The geological sample
intervals and the analytical coal quality data for the 2018 drill holes were provided in the form of
summarized datasheets as well as original laboratory reports. The information in the datasheets was crossreferenced with the original laboratory report results for more than 10% of the data.

For personal use only

To facilitate the estimation of resources and reserves in the Crown Mountain Property, Stantec developed
a geological model for the area using MineSight® software. Key horizons or “surfaces” were modelled to
provide the required inputs for volumetric estimation. Volumes were converted to tonnage by the
application of density values representative of each coal seam of interest for mining.
A three-dimensional (3D) computer model was developed and used for resource estimation purposes. The
model, which includes data from all the 2018 and historic drilling and other forms of exploration conducted,
includes three-dimensional model blocks and “solids” (“wireframe”), representing the available information
for all coal seams and splits. The results of the model construction show that the interpretation of the
geology and structure for the North and South blocks is the same as past interpretations, other than local
and more detailed changes that are apparent as a result of new site-specific data. Specifically, total
resources have reduced by approximately 8Mt due to a change in structural interpretation in the South
Block. The fault that runs along the western edge of South Block was reinterpreted to extend to the east,
which resulted in the reduction of resource estimate.
The following outlines the criteria and results obtained for coal resource estimation for the Crown Mountain
Coal Property in the Elk Valley Coalfield of SE British Columbia. The estimates have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the Canadian National Instrument (NI) 43-101 and the CIM Definition
Standards. The Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21 A Standardized Coal Resource/Reserve
Reporting System for Canada was referenced during the classification, estimation and Reporting of coal
Resources.
GSC Paper 88-21 was written in 1988 and is now obsolete with respect to certain numerical parameters. As
a result, Stantec used this paper only as a guideline during resource estimation.
NI 43-101 is the Canadian equivalent of the 2012 Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Standard. A Qualified
Person (Competent Person), who is an employee of Stantec, validated the available geological data,
constructed the computer based geological model and undertook resource estimation.
The categories of resources, identified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred, are the same in both the NI 43101 and the JORC standards of disclosure documents. Thus, for resource category definition as used in the
present report, NI 43-101 and JORC are compatible with each other. The reporting requirements of JORC
are satisfied in this report.
Stantec used the following approach to estimate the resources:
•

•
•
•

•

Update the previously created computer based geological model to reflect the additional drill hole
information gathered during the 2018 drilling campaign, as well as all additional analytical data collected
to assess the coal quality on the Property
Incorporate the Property boundaries which were obtained from published digital maps
Establish the level of geological complexity through the review of the geological maps, drill hole data
and the structural interpretation in the geological computer model
Assess the geological assurance and classify the resources through analyzing the spatial distribution of
the drill hole data, including the analytical coal quality information, the complexity of the geology and
the spatial resource distribution
Establish the stripping ratio appropriate for resource estimation and generate pit shells using reasonable
mining criteria.

For surface mining, in determining a mineral material that qualifies as a resource, the key considerations
were:

For personal use only

•
•
•

That the available technical data on the deposit be sufficient to reasonably conclude that the seams do
indeed have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction
That the seams satisfy minimum constraints for practical mining based on the specifications of the
mining equipment to be used
That a geological ratio limit, not exceeding 20:1 m3/tonne, be used to identify areas that may be
examined to assess their surface mining potential. This value is consistent with that recommended for
this purpose in GSC 88-21. It should be noted that this is not a surface mining strip ratio limit but is
simply intended to identify a resource limit within which a surface mine plan may be developed.

The following assumptions and criteria have been used in the resource estimate:
•
•
•

The resource estimate was made using a minimum seam thickness of 0.5 m
The depth limit for the potential surface mineable resource was based on a pit shell developed with a
cut-off ratio limit of 20:1 m3/tonne and 45-degree pit walls
Density values were used for the conversion of volumes of in-place coal to tonnes.

The coal resource classification is based on the following considerations:
• Geology type
• Structural complexity of seam geometry
• Coal quality variability.
The South Block is classified as “Moderate” Geological Type and the North Block is classified as “Complex”
Geological Type.
The coal resources reported are evaluated taking into account the structural complexity of seam geometry
as well as the coal quality variability of the coal. The coal resources are classified using the lower confidence
level of the two, structural and coal quality classes. In order for the coal to be classified as Measured, both
the structural and the coal quality classes should be Class 1. The coal is classified as Indicated if either the
structural class or the coal quality class is Class 2.
Due to the deficiency in the coal quality information for Seam 8 A and 8 Middle in the North Block, and Seam
8 Rider2 in the South Block, no Measured Resources are associated with these seams. All the resources from
these two seams are classified as Indicated.
The 2017 Resources are restated in Table 6 below for completeness, while the updated 2020 Resources are
provided in Table 7. All stated resources are inclusive or the reserves.

RESERVES
The JORC Code requires that at a minimum, a preliminary feasibility study or feasibility study be completed
as the basis for the definition of reserve quantities. A feasibility study has been undertaken for the Crown
Mountain Property.
Part of the initial screening work on the BFS was to develop break even strip ratio (BESR) mining pits. Stantec
accomplished that objective by using costs from the Updated 2017 PFS and revised coal sales price forecasts
of US$164 per tonne for hard coking coal (up from the US$155 per tonne sales price assumed in the Updated
2017 PFS) and US$115 per tonne for PCI coal (versus US$110 per tonne in the Updated 2017 PFS). This work,
and the mine design and economic evaluation process that followed, resulted in the identification of project
reserves, as are presented in this announcement.
Stantec has designed pits using the following minimum mining criteria in the BFS for definition of the reserve
tonnage:
•
•
•
•
•

Minimum coal seam thickness = 0.5 m
Maximum thickness included diluting material (rock parting in coal) = 0.5 m
Coal loss thickness, variable but averages 0.31 m (seam roof + floor contacts)
Dilution thickness, variable but averages 0.22 m (seam roof + floor contacts)
Bulk density as determined by seam ash % relationship.

In addition to the application of mining criteria, coal seam recovery and plant yield factors were used to
estimate the Marketable Coal Reserves on a seam-by-seam basis.
BFS PCI coal reserves have been classified based on the drill holes and insitu coal quality information used
to define the oxidized coal zones. Considerable effort was made to delineate an oxidation boundary, which
is the depth where the coal seams turn from an oxidized PCI product to a non-oxidized metallurgical product.
Data such as raw coal light transmittance, free-swelling index and the ability of the coal to float during froth
flotation were used to characterize oxidized and non-oxidized zones. Oxidized depths were incorporated in
the geology model. The result was an oxidized boundary that varies across the property. Cross sections
across both the North and South blocks were generated and the oxidation boundary depths were reviewed
paired with the structural and geological information.

The 2014 PFS and Updated 2017 PFS identified 55.8 million run-of-mine (“ROM”, “raw”) tonnes as a coal
reserve (Table 8), of which 49.7 million tonnes are classified as Proven and 6.1 million tonnes as Probable.
These reserves were underpinned by the resources contained in the referenced PEA. The BFS run-of-mine
(Table 9) identified 57.5 million as a coal reserve, of which 43.6 million tonnes are in the Proven category
and 13.9 million tonnes in the Probable category.

BFS BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND DESIGN PARAMETERS

For personal use only

Several key elements of the Updated 2017 PFS have been held as constant for the Bankable Feasibility
Study. These include:
•
•
•
•

Mining method: open pit
Annual production rate: identical to the original PFS and updated PFS at a peak annual rate of
3.7 million run-of-mine tonnes
Infrastructure location: mine and processing facility locations were not altered, however the
proposed Rail Load Out location has been altered
CAD:USD Exchange Rate.

For full disclosure purposes, these items are restated below in the text and/or the JORC table that
follows.
Jameson provided guidance to Stantec regarding the desired annual output of the operation. The
guidance provided by Jameson is summarised in Table 10 below.

Included below is a discussion of BFS assumptions and design parameters that relate to Mining,
Processing, Infrastructure, Transport, General, Coal Quality and Product Mix, Environmental Issues,
First Nations, Governmental and Third-Party Issues.
MINING
The mining method selected for Crown Mountain in the BFS is open pit. Mining equipment includes
excavators, front end loaders, and haul trucks, supported by dozers, backhoes, and blasthole drills. This
type of equipment is typical for Elk Valley mining operations, and includes equipment specific to
selective mining in certain thinner seams present on the property. The majority (90%) of overburden
removal is projected to require blasting.
Part of the initial screening work on the BFS was to develop break even strip ratio (BESR) mining pits.
Stantec accomplished that objective by using costs from the Updated 2017 PFS and revised coal sales
price forecasts of US$164 per tonne for hard coking coal (up from the US$155/t sales price assumed in
the Updated 2017 PFS) and US$115 for PCI coal (versus US$110 in the Updated 2017 PFS). This work,
and the mine design and economic evaluation process that followed, resulted in the identification of

project reserves, as are presented in this announcement. The mine plan has been sequenced to extract
the low strip ratio North block first, followed by the smaller East block (a subset of the South block, but
a distinctly higher quality and discrete mine pit) and ultimately the large South block, from South to
North. After pre-stripping, North block coal is mined.
Following geotechnical evaluation of the core recovered during the 2013 and the subsequent 2018
exploration and geotechnical program, and considering available regional data, the following design
parameters were used in the pit design:

Buttressing Requirements

It has been assumed that coal loss and out-of-seam dilution (“OSD”) occurs at every rock/coal interface
except where partings are mined as part of the ROM product. Evaluation of site-specific conditions, and
review of both local and other comparable operations, have resulted in the assumption of coal loss (pit
loss) of 0.31m per seam, and concurrent OSD of 0.20m. Best practice selective mining will be employed
over much of the Crown Mountain project area. ROM cutoffs for estimated plant yield result in any
coking coal seams under 15 percent yield and PCI under 25 percent yield being treated as waste.
Mined ROM coal is hauled from the pit to a rotary breaker where some of the larger size OSD is removed.
Stantec incorporated the findings from the previous studies and the current standard of practise to
develop the mine plan.

PROCESSING
As with the majority of Canadian metallurgical coals, a wash plant is required. The BFS, as in the PFS
located the plant proximate to the mine pits. This accomplishes multiple goals, such as:
a) it reduces trucking costs for the ROM material
b) it allows plant reject disposal to occur at or near the mine site
c) plant reject (high in shales and clays) will be used to act as oxygen depletion zones in the spoil piles,
by reducing permeability. The test work shows that limiting oxygen reduces the metal effluent
concentrations (metal leaching, particularly but not limited to selenium and nitrates, is an issue in
the Elk Valley).
Plant yield peaks in the early years when North Pit seams make the major ROM contribution ,with the
average plant yield being 61.5 percent. The East Pit plant yield is 49.9 percent, followed by a 43.8 percent
plant yield in the South Pit. The average LOM plant yield is 48.7 percent post rotary breaker. The primary
processing method is heavy media cyclone and reflux classifier, supplemented by column cell flotation for
fines recovery. A hyperbaric filter is included in the plant design to reduce the product moisture of the
fine coal.
The Updated 2017 PFS developed a traditional three-circuit coarse/small/fine with a middlings
liberation circuit. With the availability of the 2018 large diameter core bulk samples and extensive
middlings liberation testing, the middlings circuitry was reviewed and ultimately eliminated from the
design. However, the basic CPP process design remains similar to the updated PFS, except with
significant refinements to the small and fine coal circuits.
Material changes in plant design in the BFS versus the Updated 2017 PFS are:
•
•

Removal of the middlings circuit due to the marginal yield gains being achieved thereby
rendering it uneconomic
Inclusion of Plate and Frame Filters to dewater ultrafine tailings ensuring a lower moisture
aligned with incorporation into the layer cake spoil management plan.

For personal use only

Washed coal will be conveyed down the mountain (3 km) and then trucked approximately 15 km to a
stockpile/loadout area where the product will ultimately be loaded on train with a 152 railcars (16,000t
capacity) on a new rail loop to be located adjacent to Canadian Pacific’s (“CP”) existing common-user
railway. The loadout facility includes covered storage with a batch weigh bulk loading system for accurate
load control and freight cost management.

INFRASTRUCTURE
The Project is located in an area with well supported infrastructure for coal mining. Teck operates a total
of four coking coal mines in the Elk Valley and general vicinity of the Project: one of these operations is
south of Crown Mountain and three are north. As a result, mainline rail, power, supporting communities
and services are all nearby.
CP’s rail is a combined 18 km from the wash plant: 3 km of overland conveyor and a 15 km truck haul.
Power lines will be extended 14 km from the main transmission line to the preparation plant. A natural
gas line of similar length is planned to provide heat for the plant, shop, and support facilities.
Existing access roads to the Project will be upgraded: these roads have already been used for logging
operations and product transportation by a local quarry.
Water supply will originate from two sources a sediment pond located in the Alexander Creek drainage
and storage pond to be located adjacent to Grave Creek. Seasonal flow studies and estimated Project
water requirements indicate this is a viable solution.
The towns of Sparwood, Elkford, Fernie, and Crowsnest Pass will be the source of the Crown Mountain
workforce, and house numerous mining-related service industries.
TRANSPORT
Once loaded onto rail, carrier CP will transport the coal to either Westshore Terminals (‘Westshore’)
near Vancouver, or to Ridley Terminals (‘Ridley’) near Prince Rupert, where it will be loaded into ships.
Westshore, at a distance of approximately 1,200 km, is the terminal of choice for Crown Mountain coal,
with an estimated transportation cost (combined rail and port) of US$29.25/tonne.
Capacity expansion continues at the Vancouver ports. Currently Teck is undertaking an expansion
project at the Neptune Terminal where they have publicly stated they will be shipping coal from once it
is complete and their Take or Pay contract with Westshore expires in 2021. As a result, it is believed
Westshore will have available capacity when the first coal from Crown Mountain is ready for shipment.
All clean coal production from Crown Mountain is assumed to be exported. Coal is sold FOB vessel.
GENERAL
Stantec spent time collecting updated cost quotations for many items, including spare parts, fuel, labour,
etc.

Material changes to the PFS assumptions in this category are:

For personal use only

•
•

Labour rates have increased in the range of 5-7%. It is assumed Crown Mountain will pay
prevailing local wages
Fuel prices have increased by approximately 10% from the 2017 assumption in Canadian dollars.

COAL QUALITY AND PRODUCT MIX
Stantec determined from the pilot scale coke testing of North & South Block composite samples that
the majority of Crown Mountain product will be hard coking coal. A lesser quantity of PCI coal will be
produced, particularly during initial phases of South Pit mining. There will be no material amount of
thermal coal produced at Crown Mountain.
Based on the revised interpretation of the oxidization boundary completed for the BFS, the clean coal
product mix is estimated as 86% for Hard Coking coal and 14% for PCI coal.
With reference to Table 13, Kobie Koornhof Associates (‘Koornhof’), a well-respected coal market
specialist, has indicated the North and East Block coals will command near benchmark pricing. The South
Pit HCC product has been discounted to reflect certain parameters that are not as attractive as the North
Pit counterpart, placing that product in a Tier 2 category.
Table 13 presents a summary of Crown Mountain coal quality compared to other western Canadian
sources and has been updated for the 2018 exploration program and associated coal quality. Of
particular note is the relatively high (and attractive) CSR (coke strength after reaction), a property of
great importance to coal buyers.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The BFS and ongoing EA Application effort have significantly added to the Company’s understanding of
environmental issues at Crown Mountain. Importantly, with the Project located in an area populated by
operating coal mines, the environmental factors are relatively well defined.
One of the major environmental issues in the Elk Valley relates to metal leaching and its effect on water
quality. In particular selenium, nitrates, and sulphates (and to a lesser degree cadmium, calcite, and
other elements) have elevated levels in the Elk River watershed. As a result, the province formed a task
force headed by Teck that developed the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan (draft report was submitted by
Teck on 22 July 2014 and approved later that year by the province). As part of the BFS Enviromin was
engaged to undertake a two-phase laboratory study to assess the impacts on potential selenium and
nitrate mitigation in the proposed waste dumps. The laboratory studies were conducted in the flow
through columns to assess the ability of these materials and their native biological component to reduce
nitrate and selenium under controlled atmosphere conditions such as those expected in the spoil pile.
The outcomes of these two phases were detailed to the ASX on 19 November 2018 entitled ‘Significant
Success Reported on Crown Mountain Phase 2 Spoil Pile Design and Selenium Mitigation Study’.
Mitigation and control methodologies to address these issues have played a large role in the conceptual
design of the Crown Mountain spoil piles. The Company is committed to utilizing environmental best
practices across the entire operation, and will closely monitor actions by other local mines, and emerging
technologies, during the course of mine design and construction.
Initial surface water quality modelling by SRK using inputs from the Enviromin studies for the EA
demonstrates the potential for the layer cake selenium treatment method to produce water resus
equivalent to an active water treatment facility. This is a novel approach to selenium treatment which
is currently forming the basis for the Crown Mountain EA submission.
The mine plan developed for the BFS and the EA incorporates the layer cake process into the mine
sequence and has been costed accordingly.
The Company installed multiple ground water monitoring stations in 2013 and 2018 continues to collect
quarterly data. Stantec has evaluated that information and utilized the results to address issues such as
pit dewatering. The BFS does not anticipate any material environmental challenges associated with
groundwater.
Additional permits must be acquired by the Company before mine construction can commence.
As a precursor to permitting, Jameson entered the pre-application phase of the EA process in 2014 and
has progressed through development and submittal of the Valued Components Document (“VCD”). In
April 2018 Jameson received the Application Information Requirements (“AIR”). Upon receipt of the
AIR Jameson began planning and preparation of the Application for an Environmental Assessment
certificate. This AIR has a finite, three-year life under which the Environmental Assessment Application
may be lodged which will conclude in April 2021. The Application for the Environmental Certificate is
well advanced with baseline studies and modelling complete. Effects assessments have commenced
being written up and the EA Application is on track for a March quarter 2021 submission. The Mine
Permit itself, and other related permits, must also be prepared and submitted for approval.

FIRST NATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL AND THIRD-PARTY ISSUES
Crown Mountain is located in traditional First Nations territory. The Ktunaxa Nation Council (‘KNC’) are
sole rights and title holders to the Crown Mountain project. Jameson meets regularly with the KNC and
has established a policy of close cooperation and open communication as the project moves forward.
There are a number of other First Nations that have rights and interests for the Project area. First
Nations are intimately involved in the EA Application and mine permitting process through the referral
and consultation routines established between First Nations, Federal and Provincial governments. It is
incumbent on the Province, and in turn Jameson, to understand and address the issues brought forth by
First Nations.
Jameson representatives have consulted frequently with First Nations since acquiring the original option
on Crown Mountain, and will continue to do so during permitting, construction, and mine operation.
In addition to First Nations, there are governmental and private entities that have certain interests with
respect to land use, and can be expected to participate in the permitting process through referral and
comment. Such entities include, but are not limited to, local governing authorities and special use
organizations such as recreational clubs, etc.
The Company has previously met with the local governments (councils, mayors) of all the nearby towns
including Sparwood, Elkford, Fernie, and the District of Crowsnest Pass. Through events such as an Open
House, and the VCD commenting process, Jameson has also had discussions with non-governmental
organizations regarding their special issues and concerns.
All mining and coal processing activities, including refuse and spoil disposal, will occur on Crown land now
controlled by Jameson via Coal Licenses. The water supply, access and haulage roads, and preferred rail
loop/loadout site are on property controlled by one or more third parties. It is assumed in the BFS that
the necessary access and surface disturbance rights will be acquired without major issue. Certain
preliminary documents such as road use agreements and limited access agreements have been in place
for several years.
BFS RESULTS
CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
The Total Pre-Production Capital expenditure to support the mining and processing operation has been
estimated in the BFS Update to be US$351 million (CA$468m) as detailed in Table 15.

A lease financing scenario has also been examined by Stantec designed to reduce start- up capital whilst
preserving the overall performance of the project. For the major mining equipment, Stantec obtained
leasing information as an alternative to buying. Lease rates were obtained for new equipment over a 5
year life with no residual. The leasing rate was assumed to be 5.5% (rates provided varied between 4.9%
to 5.5%) as provided by equipment vendors. Longer and more favourable terms may be available once
actual bids are placed, potentially lowering operating costs.

FINANCIAL MEASURES
The LOM is estimated at 15 years, with annual clean coal sales ranging up to 2.3Mtpa based on plant
yields, which vary by mining area. A total of 26.3 million tonnes of clean coal are estimated to be sold,
of which 22.5 million tonnes is hard coking coal, and the balance PCI.
The clean coal stripping ratio (BCM of waste to tonne of clean coal) ranges from 5.1:1 to 8.6:1 during the
first 4 years of operation. This is considered to be low and attractive relative to other surface coking coal
projects. The low LOM clean strip ratio of 10.3:1 is due to Crown Mountain’s topography and the
presence of several major coal seams near surface.
Primary outputs from the BFS are listed in Table 18 (pre-tax) and Table 19 (after-tax). Results for the
alternate financing options are included.

STAFFING

For personal use only

The mine and plant are staffed to operate 365 days per year, 24 hours per day, less statutory holidays
scheduled downtime, and estimated delays due to weather and other events.
Peak hourly labour employment is 260 persons. Staff, which includes supervisory and administrative
personnel, totals 69 for a total of 329 direct employees.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Stantec has performed a sensitivity analysis by varying certain factors over the life of the operation, the
results of which are presented in Table 20. The selected parameters evaluated are:
•

Coal Sales Price: The model is most sensitive to relative moves in the coal sales price. The price
variations were applied to both coking coal and PCI, across all production areas life-of-mine.

•

Port: The BFS has assumed shipping out of a Vancouver coal terminal, preferably Westshore.
Should that prove unachievable due to capacity constraints (which are not considered likely in
the BFS), there is an additional cost of US$12 per tonne to transport coal to the Ridley terminal
in NW BC. The base case pre-tax IRR of 36.4% would drop to 27.5% in that event.

•

Operating Cost: Sensitivities to +/- 10% and +/- 20% were evaluated. Operating costs include
ore and waste mining, preparation plant, clean coal handling, reclamation, minor equipment,
marketing, corporate, and administration (rail and port costs are excluded). The effect on
economics is not as significant as coal sales price variation.

•

Capital Cost: As with operating cost, the effect is not as impactful as varying the coal sales price.
The +/- 10% is applied to base capital, sustaining capital and the capital contingency.

•

Exchange Rate: Along with coal sales price, the model is very sensitive to movements in the
exchange rate.

PROJECT FINANCING
All material assumptions for the BFS are outlined in this report. These include assumptions about the
availability of funding. While the Company considers all of the material assumptions to be based on
reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the range of outcomes
indicated by the BFS will be achieved. Funding for pre-production capital expenditure in the order of
US$351 million (which incorporates a 10% contingency allowance) will be required if the company
purchases all of the mobile mining equipment, shop, washbays and ancillary equipment. The scenario
presented in the BFS assumes all capital items are purchased. As part of optmisation studies, and as the
project gets closer to investment decision alternative funding arrangements (e.g. leasing or contract
mining) for the aforementioned items will be examined, as is common practice in the mining industry.
This has the potential to reduce the pre-production capital requirement.
Jameson currently has an agreement (for further details see ASX announcement released 29 June 2018
entitled Jameson Reaches Agreement with Strategic Partner to Advance Crown Mountain) with Bathurst
Resources Limited (‘BRL’) whereby, at BRL’s discretion, once the BFS is complete and the required
permits have been issued BRL has the option to sole fund the first CA$110m of construction costs in the
form of cash to take their shareholding in NWP Coal Canada Ltd to 50%. CA$2.6m of this CA$110m has
been advanced already under BRL’s Tranche 2 option advance leaving CA$107.4m at their discretion.
The Company anticipates that the source of funding for the capital investment will be any one, or a
combination of, equity, debt, the use of contractors (to reduce overall pre-production capital
requirements) and pre-paid offtake from the project. Whilst no final decision has been made in that
regard, the financial model assumes a maximum A$280 million in debt (representing a 60:40 debt:
equity split, also assumed in the risk adjusted Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’)). The Company

has undertaken discussions with potential debt financiers for the project. As noted above, the financial
model provides for debt capacity and is designed to meet the expectations of any providers of potential
debt funding for their due diligence and other internal requirements. The Company cautions that any
funding by way of an equity issue may be dilutive to existing shareholders.
KEY RISKS
The material risks identified in the BFS are listed below:
•

Market Risk: The Stantec economics are based on pricing forecasts from a reputable and
respected source (Koornhof), however there is no guarantee these forecasts will prove
accurate.

•

Coal Quality: While the historical 2013 exploration program has provided what is believed to be
reliable and detailed coal quality information, that was supported by the results from the 2018
exploration program; there remains some risk until actual sample shipments have been made
from Crown Mountain to prospective customers and accepted as compliant to their
specifications.

•

Plant Yield: Significant information on coal washability was acquired during the summer 2018
bulk sampling and washability evaluation program. This data is deemed to be sufficient for BFS
level engineering. Plant yield has been specifically estimated for each mining area (North, East,
and South).

•

Environmental/Permitting: The EA application is being developed to meet the requirements
detailed in the Application Information Requirements (AIR) issued in April 2018 for the Crown
Mountain project. While the environmental base line program (much of which is completed,
some of which is ongoing), and modelling efforts to support the EA Application has greatly
expanded the knowledge base at Crown Mountain, NWP is not in a position at this time to
accurately determine the government’s decision to what environmental and mining permits
NWP may in the future submit. Further, the siting of certain infrastructure is subject to ongoing
environmental studies and the cooperation of the parties controlling the respective areas

•

Port: At this time, it appears likely that sufficient port capacity, based on the current expansion
plans of Neptune Terminals, will exist once Crown Mountain commences operation. However,
there are several other coal projects under evaluation in western Canada which also
contemplate export. Jameson does not at this time hold a contract for port capacity. Until a
contract is executed, there remains a risk associated with this category. In addition, should a
contract be signed, a new risk may be present if the contracts contain any economic penalties
for not meeting committed tonnages, such as take-or- pay stipulations.

•

Mining Risk: The assumptions regarding the mining operation are based on exploration results
and experience in similar geo-mining conditions by Stantec. Equipment selection and
performance are based on assumptions believed to be suitable for the Project, however, there
is no guarantee the results predicted in the BFS will be achieved should excursions from the
assumptions occur.

•

COVID-19: the potential adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (Covid-19) on future Project
development and efficient operations. Consideration, is and will continue to be, given to
mitigation measures including using wider ranges for the stress testing of business scenarios,
project economics, consideration of alternate fundraising strategies and establishing Covid-19
management protocols during Project development and operation.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria listed in this section also apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria

JORC Code explanation

Commentary

Sampling
techniques

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific
specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as downhole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as
limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and
the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to
the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be
relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m
samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for
fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as
where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems.
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg, submarine nodules)
may warrant
disclosure of detailed information.

• Reverse circulation (“RC”) and large diameter core (“LDC”) drilling was used
to collect samples.
• The samples from RC drilling were collected on 0.5m intervals as soon as
coal zones were reached. Drilling was stopped between each sample for
dewatering and to allow accurate interval separation.
• Sample bags were assigned with hole and individual sample numbers, ziptied and stored in heavy duty plastic tubs for transportation to laboratory.
• For LDC drilling, seam composite samples were collected from the entire
coal zone for all coal zones ≥0.5m. Partings greater than 0.5 m true
thickness were sampled and analyzed separately from the coal samples.
• The top and bottom 0.2m of rock in contact with the coal zone were
sampled and analyzed for use in out-of-seam dilution evaluation. In
addition, coal seams marginally below 0.5m were sampled for separate
analysis but are not currently used in the coal quality model.
• For the coal quality assessment only samples from LDC drilling were used.
• A suite of geophysical logs, including density, gamma, resistivity, neutron,
temperature and drill hole deviation were run both within drill pipe and in
the open hole where ground conditions permitted.
• Sample was collected in polywoven cloth and/or high strength
polyethylene bags on approximately 0.5 metre intervals.

Drilling
techniques

• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast,
auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard
tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether
core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).

Drill sample
recovery

• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries
and results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade
and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential
loss/gain of fine/coarse material.

• In 2012 NWP Coal Canada Ltd. (NWP Coal) undertook an exploration drilling
program which included 40 reverse circulation drill holes with a cumulative
total drilled meterage of 5,707 m.
• In 2013 NWP Coal undertook an exploration drilling program which included
a total of 6 RC drill holes and 7 LDC (150mm) core holes with a cumulative
total drilled meterage of 1,653 m.
• The 2018 NWP Coal exploration program consisted of 33 drill holes with a
cumulative total drilled meterage of 4,711 m. The drilling program included
16 LDC holes, 10 RC holes, as well as seven small diameter (75mm) core
(SDC) fully cored geotechnical holes.
• LDC holes were twinned from new or existing pilot holes and were drilled
vertically. All coal intervals were cored. In 2013, selected non-coal intervals
were cored for geotechnical purposes.
• SDC holes - in 2018 seven holes were completely cored for geotechnical
purposes.
• RC holes were drilled using a conventional face hammer, PDC or tri-cone
drill bit.
• Core recovery in the coal intervals from the LDC holes was 95% in 2013
and 89% in 2018 on average basis. Expected depth to coal seams was
known from the geophysical log of the RC pilot hole. The driller was
advised prior to reaching the top of the seam. Core catcher tools were
used through less competent coal zones to ensure maximum recovery.
• For the majority of LDC holes, all of the coal seam recovered was
submitted to a laboratory for coal quality test work.
• 2012 RC samples were largely wet and passed over a static 100 mesh
screen. 2013 RC samples were passed over a 325-mesh vibrating screen to
ensure most of the fine coal was retained and dewatered to the extent
practical. The 2018 RC holes were largely for pilot purposes to guide LDC
drilling and not all were sampled (selected holes were sampled over a 325mesh vibrating screen).
• Limited coal was recovered from the SDC geotechnical holes: the target for
that drilling was non-coal intervals, and coal recovery was not an objective.

Logging

• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate
Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.

• All core was photographed immediately following separation of the split
barrel at the rig and also following mark-up.
• Core was geologically and geotechnically logged before sampling and
shipment to laboratory.
• All holes were geologically and geophysically logged.
• A suite of geophysical logs, including density, gamma, resistivity, neutron,
temperature and drill hole deviation were run both within drill pipe and in
the open hole where ground conditions permitted.
• All geophysical tools were calibrated by the logging company (Century
Wireline) using their internal calibration procedures.
• Geophysical logs were analysed extensively and used to confirm and correct
geological logs. Validation of geological logs against geophysics were
undertaken to ensure accuracy.
• In 2012 and 2013 all core coal samples were bagged and placed into heavy
duty plastic tubs on-site before being transported to Birtley Coal & Minerals
(“Birtley”) in Calgary for coal quality test work. In 2018 the bagged samples
were stored in a refrigerated trailer before and during transport to Birtley.
• Roof and floor dilution samples were also collected, and all collected
materials were sent to the laboratory for test work.
• Core samples from the roof and floor along with selected zones of
interburden were retained for metal leaching and acid rock drainage
analysis. The British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines and
Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) requires this data as part of the
environmental approvals process.
• All remaining core sample (non-coal) from 2013 was retained in wooden
boxes on pallets at each drill site within project area. Those samples were
shipped to a geochemical laboratory in 2018 for analysis. There are no core
samples remaining on site.
• The majority of RC sample collected through the coal zones were retained.

of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.

• Birtley adheres to ASTM and ISO preparation and testing specifications and
has Quality Control processes in place. These processes include using
control samples and running duplicate runs of samples, inclusion of blind
samples for checking of instrument and operator repeatability and running
quality control checks before and after every batch of samples to ensure the
instrument is performing within tww standard deviations.
• Birtley adopts standard Quality Assurance procedures participates in the
International Canadian Coal Laboratories Round Robin Series (CANSPEX)
since its inception.
• Select samples from the 2018 program were forwarded to two other
laboratories (SGS – Delta and CanmetENERGY) for a comparison on raw ash
and FSI. Generally, Birtley and SGS FSIs were similar and any variation
between their two datasets was random – not biased in one direction.
Canmet FSIs were generally higher than both SGS and Birtley. There was one
raw coal sample where the difference in FSI between the three labs was 2.5.
This was likely due to a subsample error on Birtley’s account.
• Clean coal sample blends of the North and South Blocks were analysed both
at Birtley Coal and CanmetENERGY as part of a mini ‘round robin’ check. The
results from both Birtley and CanmetENERGY are very similar for all analyses
and within the repeatability criteria for the standard.
• Geophysical tools were calibrated by the logging company Century Wireline
using their internal calibration procedures.
• Petrography analysis in 2013 were completed by CoalTech Petrographic
Association of Pennsylvania in 2012. The laboratory follows ASTM Standards
D2797, D2798 and D2799.
• In 2018, Pearson Coal Petrography completed the petrographic analyses on
this project. The laboratory follows ISO 7404/5 for testing and reporting of
Vitrinite Reflectance and ASTM D2799 and ISO 7404-3 for testing and
reporting of Maceral Analysis. Pearson undertakes regular recalibration of
their photometers, they use two methods of determining vitrinite
reflectance to ensure accurate results and they run monthly internal round

• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades)
and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for
such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.

• At Crown Mountain, 104 holes have been drilled on site totaling 14,653 m.
NWP Coal drilled 33 holes in 2018, 13 in 2013, and 40 in 2012. There are 18
holes drilled by others between 1969 and 1979. Some of the holes were
drilled as angle holes.
• All of the holes excluding CMR69-25 and CMR-79-102 were used in the 2019

and CM12-18 are used instead.
• Twelve trenches, 39 outcrop points with coal description and 203 outcrop
points with dip and dip direction data were used in the 2019 resource model
development.
• A full list of the drill holes including easting, northing, elevation, dip and
azimuth, downhole depth and coal zone combined thickness and hole
length was reported to the ASX on 2 August 2019 entitled ‘Crown Mountain
Coal/Coke Testing Program Complete: Hard Coking Coal Confirmed

Relationship
between
mineralisation
widths and
intercept lengths

• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is
known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true
width not known’).

Diagrams

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts
should be included for any significant discovery being reported These
should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar
locations and appropriate sectional views.

• All 2013 and 2018 holes were drilled vertical. Drill holes had a natural
tendency to deviate from vertical because of the varying dips of strata and
variance in competency between coal seams and harder sandstone partings.
Downhole survey was completed on every hole and was loaded into the
model so the most accurate location of the coal intercepts were used.
• Differentiation of coal mineable thickness from separable waste intervals is
based on true thickness. Using the down-hole survey for each drill hole, in
combination with footwall polylines of each seam, an algorithm was used to
convert down-hole lengths into true thickness for each of the intervals in a
given coal zone.
• Diagrams drawn to JORC listed requirements were prepared in 2020 by
Stantec. Diagrams include location maps, drill hole location plans and
appropriate cross-sectional views and are included in Diagrams 1-7 in this
announcement.

Balanced
reporting

• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or
widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey
results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of
treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.

Other
substantive
exploration data

• Stantec completed a resource estimate for Crown Mountain based on all
available information deemed relevant.

• Crown Mountain seams appear to have higher run of mine (ROM) ash than
other operating mines in the Elk Valley based on published information. The
higher ROM ash results in lower plant yield in some areas of the mine and
this is reflected in the modelled plant yield.
• Groundwater has been encountered in drill holes. 26 ground water
monitoring stations (standpipes) have been installed in selected LDC holes
or in drilled-for-purpose monitoring wells in and outside of the proposed pit
limits. The groundwater information has been included in the EA
submission.
• As a requirement of the Environmental Assessment process, significant rock
core and cuttings have been collected from the 2013 and 2018 drilling
campaigns to assess potential metal leaching and acid rock drainage issues.

• Nature of the data used and of any assumptions made.
• The effect, if any, of alternative interpretations on Mineral Resource
estimation.
• The use of geology in guiding and controlling Mineral Resource estimation.
• The factors affecting continuity both of grade and geology.
• The extent and variability of the Mineral Resource expressed as length
(along strike or otherwise), plan width, and depth below surface to the
upper and lower limits of the Mineral Resource.

• Geological interpretation of stratigraphy and seam continuity is at a stage
where confidence is high.
• The most recent interpretation of the overall strata has been undertaken
based on the 3D geological model which was updated with the 2018
exploration data.
• Raw and clean coal quality were modelled as part of the geologic work
completed and incorporated into the resource and reserve estimation.
• The Crown Mountain property is divided into two distinct structural
domains separated by a northerly trending thrust fault or CMF. There are
three prospects within the project area, the “North Block” which is
positioned above the CMF and the “South Block” and “Southern Extension”
which are both below the CMF. The “Southern Extension” is excluded from
the current study.
• Strike lengths for each of the three prospects are: North Block – 1.5km,
South Block - 4.4km and Southern Extension – 4.1km.
• The major seams in the North Block are structurally bound within a south
plunging syncline, extending from surface to a maximum depth of 155m.
Coal seams in the South Block extend from surface to a maximum depth of
150m and are structurally bound within a syncline that has been truncated
by the thrust fault and only the east limb of the syncline remains.
• The Southern Extension is a continuation of the South Block coal measures.
Based on structural mapping, there is evidence for increased structural
complexity.

key assumptions, including treatment of extreme grade values, domaining,
interpolation parameters and maximum distance of extrapolation from
data points. If a computer assisted estimation method was chosen include
a description of computer software and parameters used.
• The availability of check estimates, previous estimates and/or mine
production records and whether the Mineral Resource estimate takes
appropriate account of such data.
• The assumptions made regarding recovery of by-products.
• Estimation of deleterious elements or other non-grade variables of
economic significance (eg sulphur for acid mine drainage characterisation).

• Discussion of basis for using or not using grade cutting or capping.
• The process of validation, the checking process used, the comparison of
model data to drill hole data, and use of reconciliation data if available.

• The resource estimation for the Crown Mountain project are based on the
resource model developed using Hexagon Mining’s geological modelling
and mine planning software, MinePlan (MineSight). This system is widely
used throughout the mining industry for digital resource model
development.
• The selected block size was based on the density of the drill hole dataset as
well as the requirements for the mining selectivity and bench height of this
deposit, in this case being 25m x 25m x 5m (length x width x height).
• The Geological Type is classified (CIM Definition Standards –GSC Paper 8821). as “Moderate” in the South Block and “Complex” in the North Block.
The Southern Extension area has been explored to a much lesser extent than
the other two blocks. This area is currently categorized as a "moderate
geology type" because it is similar to the South Block that it adjoins to the
north.
• The potentially acid generating (PAG) zones are well known in the Morrissey
Formation, which has been confirmed by the geochemical data collected for
the EA. The experience at the other Elk Valley mines demonstrate that there
is overwhelming neutralizing material to offset any potential for acid
generation.
• There was no grade cutting or capping applied to the geology. All the grade
data is used as reported by the laboratories in the geology modelling.
• The interpolated model variables have been mapped and validated with the
drill hole data. The drill hole seam thicknesses were compared to the
modelled seam thicknesses so that the drill holes were honoured. A
statistical approach was used to validate the average seam thickness from
the model with the average de-clustered drill hole seam thickness.
• The following procedures were used to construct the 3D block model:
• The drill hole coal plies from one coal zone have been assigned into seam
groups. The seam group’s true thickness values were calculated. The
calculated true thickness values and the coal footwall polylines were used
to construct the top of the seam group and create closed seam polygons
on each section;

wireframed surface;
• Oxidation depth on the property was assessed using the available FSI and
LT% data from the drill holes. The interpretation of the oxidization
boundary was completed on a drill hole by drill hole basis. Based on the
interpretation, a wireframed surface was constructed at the bottom of
the estimated oxidation zone,
• All of the coal solids were then clipped against faults and topography
surfaces;
• The bottom of the oxidation zone surface was used to split the coal solids
into two sets: oxidized coal solids and non-oxidized coal solids;
• The clipped coal solids (oxidized and non-oxidized) were used to populate
the model blocks with Seam Group codes, and to determine the volume
percentage of the solids contained within a particular model block;
• Where more than one solid intersected a model block, additional seam
identifiers and volume percentage attributes were populated using a
“top-down” stratigraphic priority order;
• An inverse-distance-to the power of three based algorithm was used to
interpolate the composited ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, total sulfur
and calorific values, mineable percentage and number of the coal-waste
contacts into the model blocks for each seam;
• To account for the variability of the percent non-separable parting within
the mineable coal volumes from drill hole to drill hole, an adjustment to

• The greatest potential impacts of surface mining are likely to be those that
affect surface water. In February 2013, Teck submitted the Valley-Wide
Selenium Management Action Plan for Teck Coal Limited Operations in the Elk
Valley. This action plan addressed the selenium release by the five Teck
surface mines. The BFS selenium mitigation plan will place layers of plant
rejects (filtered to reduce water content) within the waste rock pile. The
layering technique has been shown at the laboratory scale and through
modeling, to have the potential to reduce the levels of selenium and nitrate
in the surface water that seeps through the waste rock piles. For the BFS, it is
assumed that for every 50 m high waste rock lift, a 1m layer of plant rejects
will be placed. The 50 to 1 ratio is based on the preliminary testing and
modeling results completed by SRK Consulting (SRK). Modeling, based on
laboratory studies, demonstrates that a successful implementation of the
WRD Layer Cake design at the Crown Mountain Project will result in
predicated water quality that would be similar to other operations that have

• The method of mining used in the bankable feasibility study is open cut
mining, using a fleet of excavators/shovels, loaders, dozers, and trucks
consistent with similar operations in the general vicinity of western
Canada.
• The coal tonnage from the pit is reported in run-of-mine (ROM) basis
which assumed an as-received moisture content of 4%.
• Pit slopes and berm width/spacing were determined after review of
available geotechnical information. A permit level (detailed) pit wall design
report has been completed. Additional geotechnical data will be collected
to support future detailed mine planning.
• Pit optimization was based on a strip ratio of 18.5:1 ROM tonne break even
stripping ratio analysis using hard coking coal benchmark price of USD$165.
A coal sales price of USD$165 per tonne was applied for the metallurgical
coal. The prices are converted to Canadian dollars at a USD/CAD exchange
rate of USD1.00/CAD0.75.
• Different coal loss and dilution assumption is used for different mining areas
and coal seams due to change in dip of the bedding and the types of the coal
to waste contacts. The weighted average of the external seam dilution is
0.22m per seam, and 0.31m per seam for coal loss.
• Mining recovery is the result of applying the dilution factors above and
varies by seam thickness.
• The minimum mineable seam thickness is 0.5m.

• Coal processing will be by heavy media washing and froth floatation. The
process flow was developed by Stantec, using Limn modelling, and
independently modelled by Sedgman who reviewed the process design and
undertook plant design and costing for the coal handling and processing plant
for the BFS.
• Only commercially proven, coal washing processes have been
incorporated into the plan. Steam assisted hyperbaric disc filtration has
been selected for dewatering flotation product, instead of thermal drying,
typically used in the Elk Valley. This technology is relatively new to the coal
industry, but is under consideration for other Elk Valley mines.
• A product moisture of 9% is assumed. A product Total Moisture of <7% is
predicted ex the CPP from LIMN modelling by Stantec. This level is below the
assumed customer specification of 9%, typical for Elk Valley coals, and will
allow for some moisture gains in the transportation logistics chain.
• Coal washability testing was performed in 2013/2014 on bulk samples
collected in Q3 2013 via large diameter coring. Additional drilling was done

• The PCI in the North, East and South Blocks has been determined at 97.5%
of the Low Volatile Matter PCI (‘LVPCI’), prior to any penalty for
phosphorous.
• The South Block is penalised for higher phosphorous compared with the
LVPCI specification and has therefore been discounted accordingly.
• The LVPCI price is based on the 10 year historical relationship between the
LVPCI price relative to the Low Volatile Matter, Premium Hard Coking Coal
Price.
• The assumed prices for North and East Block PCI is US$115/t while the South
