Riley Iron Ore Mine – Production Ready following
signing of Port Access Agreement

▪ Venture completes another important milestone with the signing
of the Port Access Agreement;
▪ The path to Iron Ore production at Riley is now fully in place from
mine gate to shipping (Refer to Figure 1);
▪ Venture advancing debt funding options to facilitate first shipment
as early as next month;
▪ Riley Mine economics still well above feasibility numbers (Refer to
ASX announcement 22 August 2019 ) due to higher Iron Ore prices
(>US$100/tonne 62% Fe price*) and lower fuel prices, and
further supported by a strong Fe market outlook;
▪ Offtake for full two-year mine life with Prosperity Steel extended
to meet new production start time (Refer to ASX announcement 2 May 2019).
Venture Minerals Limited (ASX:VMS) (“Venture” or the “Company”) is pleased to
announce that it has completed another important milestone with the signing of the
Port Access Agreement with TasPorts, which owns the wharf and infrastructure at
the Port of Burnie (refer to Figures 2 & 3). This agreement fully secures the pathway for
Riley Iron Ore production from mine gate to shipping. This effectively means that
mining can commence immediately subject to completion of financing.
With on-site infrastructure already complete (see ASX announcement 26 November 2019)
the Riley Mining Team can commence ore mining and dry screening activities on
short notice and at very low cost, given the zero strip ratio (iron ore at surface)
characteristics of the Riley DSO deposit.
Iron Ore prices remain at historically significant levels having recently hit 10-month
highs. Further, the outlook for iron ore prices for the rest of the year remains very
positive due to strong demand supported by Chinese government backed
infrastructure spending and growing supply concerns from Brazil due to the COVID19 outbreak.
Venture is now seeking to finalise discussions on financing options including a debt
facility to fund working capital to sustain mining operations and capital to complete
construction of the wet screening plant at Riley. A decision on these funding
initiatives and a Final Investment Decision (FID) will be made by the Board and
advised to the market as soon as possible.
The Company is also concluding the road haulage tender process and will continue
to work on achieving more efficient ore handling logistics, including finalising
negotiations on gaining access to other on-wharf storage.
* Based on spot pricing of US$103.45 per tonne as at 8 July 2020 referenced to the CFR 62% Fe Platts benchmark pricing index.

Commenting on reaching another important milestone towards Riley Iron Ore Mine production, Venture
Minerals’ Managing Director Andrew Radonjic, said:
“After running a parallel process in finalising the Road Access Agreement with Hydro Tasmania, the Riley
Team has been able to quickly conclude the Port Access Agreement with TasPorts. Venture is now in a
position to commence mining, subject to the conclusion of financing negotiations, and looks forward to
improving the efficiencies of the ore handling logistics and locking in access to further on-wharf storage.
This continues to be an exciting phase for the Company and its shareholders as the Company moves from
explorer to producer. The Riley Iron Ore Mine will create close to 100 jobs and will be a boost for the economy
of the West Coast of Tasmania during these unprecedented times. Venture will ensure it continues to update
its shareholders as it transitions from an explorer to first mining and production at Riley”.
