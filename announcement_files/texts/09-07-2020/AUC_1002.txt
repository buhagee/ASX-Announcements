

DHEM geophysics is proving an effective tool in targeting high grade gold mineralisation at Katanning and
shows this mineralisation is open to the north for a significant strike length



Results demonstrate potential for Jinkas South to add significant high grade ounces to the existing 1.2
million ounce gold Resource at Katanning



RC drilling of this high grade lode is continuing with results anticipated

Ausgold Limited (ASX: AUC) (“Ausgold” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the results for the first 6 holes
of a 21 hole 3,200m program of reverse circulation (RC) drilling at the Central Zone within its 100%-owned
Katanning Gold Project (“KGP”) in Western Australia’s south-west.
New drilling has used down hole electromagnetic (DHEM) and Moving Loop EM (MLEM) to target drilling located
along strike from areas of high-grade gold mineralisation intercepted at the Jinkas South and Jinkas areas (Figure 1
& Figure 2). Significant intercepts from this RC drilling are shown in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 including:

These drilling results are highly significant as they validate both the geological model that is predicting the location
of high grade gold mineralisation and the effectiveness of the geophysics being used to directly target this
mineralisation. Most importantly they show the potential for the Jinkas South lode to add substantial high grade
ounces to the existing 1.2 million ounce gold Resource at Katanning.
Gold mineralisation within the Central Zone is localised around a sill-like quartz monzonite (granite) body which
dips towards the east. This body separates the Jinkas lode from the White Dam lode, and the highest gold grades
occur where these two stacked lodes coalesce in the down-dip position along the eastern edge of the current
Resource, namely the Jinkas South lode. Recent RC drilling along the Jinkas South lode extends the high-grade
gold mineralisation to over 580m north along strike on the eastern edge of the defined Resource (Figure 1 and 2).
Recent work has focused on the geological controls on Jinkas South high grade mineralisation, primarily focused on
key host rock associations and the accompanying of pyrrhotite – magnetite alteration zones. This recent drill
program is being followed-up with an additional DHEM program and drilling is planned to extend the Jinkas South
lode north along strike.

Management Comment
Ausgold’s Managing Director, Matthew Greentree, commented:
“We are pleased with the high-grade gold mineralisation intersected within the initial RC drilling results which
significantly extend the Jinkas South lode to a strike length of over 580m. The new drilling has validated the
geological model and the initial DHEM targets, providing clear confirmation that the high-grade Jinkas South lode
extends over a significant strike length and remains open along strike. This zone remains open with drilling underway
to test three additional DHEM targets north of the currently identified Jinkas South mineralisation.
The high grade Jinkas South gold mineralisation has been now shown to extend north along strike and will add to
the current 1.2 Moz gold Resource at Katanning. The new drilling shows high-grade gold mineralisation extends
well beyond that estimated in the current resource model. This will further expand the open pit Resource and further
improve the project economics.
Further drilling is planned to target high-grade mineralisation down dip and north along strike where it remains
open, Ausgold is extending the coverage of DHEM to target this mineralisation”

Other work programs
The 3,200m RC drill program is continuing and will test a further eight EM targets. Planning has commenced for a
follow-up program of DHEM to be conducted on recent drill holes which will enable targeted step-out drilling. This
will be followed by a 2,200m RC drilling program of the Jinkas North area which is to be partially funded by the WA
Government Exploration Incentive Scheme. Additional work is underway within the regional KGP, which includes
mapping, reconnaissance rock chip sampling for both gold and PGM. The results for this new drilling program along
with 6,600m of drilling completed this year will provide the basis for a Resource upgrade and further study work in
late 2020.

JORC Code explanation
 Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut
channels, random chips, or specific specialised
industry
standard
measurement
tools
appropriate to the minerals under investigation,
such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld
XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not
be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation
that are Material to the Public Report.
 In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been
done this would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m
samples from which 3kg was pulverised to
produce a 30g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases more explanation may be required, such as
where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules)
may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
 Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, openhole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka,
sonic, etc) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple
or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, facesampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
 Method of recording and assessing core and chip
sample recoveries and results assessed.
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery
and ensure representative nature of the samples.

Commentary
The reverse circulation (“RC”) drilling program referred to in this announcement consisted of 6 reverse
circulation holes for 943m.
Samples from RC drilling were collected in one metre intervals in mineralised zones with a 1/8 split for assay,
split by a cyclone-mounted cone splitter, bagged in pre-numbered calico bags and the remainder retained
in large plastic bags.
QAQC samples consisting of field duplicates (additional split from RC), with standards and blanks inserted
into the sequence of assay samples at a rate of 1 in 10.
Each RC metre sampled weighed approximately 2 to 3 kilograms. All RC samples were sent to ALS
Laboratories for crushing and pulverising to produce a 50 gram sample charge for analysis by fire assay and
flame atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).

Holes BSRC0961 - 965 in this program were collected from RC drilling conducted by PXD Services Pty Ltd
using a truck mounted 450 Schramm reverse circulation drill rig. Hole BSRC0966 was conducted using a track
mounted 450 schramm reverse circulation drill rig.

Samples were collected dry with occasional damp samples, sample recoveries were visually estimated as a
semi-quantitative range and recorded in the log.
Recoveries were generally excellent (>90%), with reduced recovery in the initial near- surface sample and
transported cover material.

Commentary
Drill cyclone and sample bags were used to collect the 1m samples and cleaned between rod changes. In
addition, the cyclone was generally cleaned several times during each hole (at the base of transported cover
and the base of completed oxidation) and after each hole to minimise downhole and/or cross- hole
contamination.
The relationship between sample recovery and grade and whether bias has been introduced has not been
investigated at this stage.
All drill holes in the current program have been geologically logged to a level of detail to support the
definition of geological domains appropriate to support exploration work. The 1m sampling is appropriate
for mineral resource estimation.
Representative rock chips were collected in chip trays and logged by the geologist at the drill site. Sample
condition and degree of weathering were recorded qualitatively; geotechnical logging is not possible on RC
samples.
Lithology, weathering (oxidation state), structure, veining, mineralisation and alteration are recorded in
detail using standard digital logging sheets and defined look up tables to ensure that all data is collected
consistently. This data is logged using tablet computers. All data is validated by the logging geologist before
being entered in an acQuire database. All drill holes are logged.
Dry samples below transported cover are riffle split to obtain representative 1m samples (submitted when
anomalous). The samples were recorded as dry, damp or wet. Sample duplicates were obtained by repeating
the composite sampling process.
All RC samples were sorted, dried, crushed to 10mm, pulverised to -75µm, split to produce a 50 g charge for
fire assay.

The gold was determined using a 50 g charge using fire assay (Au-AA26).
For QAQC samples, a sequence of matrix matched certified reference materials, commercial certified
reference materials and blanks were inserted into the sample run at a frequency of approximately one in 14
samples. Sample sizes are considered to be appropriate for the style/texture of oxide and sulphide
mineralisation at the Katanning Gold Project.

trenches, mine workings and other locations used
in Mineral Resource estimation.
 Specification of the grid system used.

Commentary
CRM’s, field duplicates, blanks and standards were inserted approximately every 10m. Blank samples are
inserted to check for contamination in field sampling, laboratory sample preparation and analysis. The blank
material used should be below detection limits.
The gold standards were sourced from Geostats Pty Ltd and RockLabs with gold certified values ranging
between 0.10g/t and 2.4g/t. Standard reference materials are used to check accuracy and bias of the
analytical method. The results were similar to the standard concentration for the specific standard.
QAQC samples were monitored on a batch-by-batch basis. An assay batch is accepted if the blank samples
are within the acceptable limits (5 times the lower detection limit) and the standards are within the + 3SD
(standard deviations). One failed standard can cause rejection if the results around the failed standard are
not in the normal grade range. A batch is also re-assayed when assay results from two or more standards
are outside the acceptable limits. The inserted blank materials did not show any consistent issues with
sample contamination.
100% of the gold standards assays were within acceptable limits with no low or high bias.
The performance of field duplicates in RC samples is generally reasonable and the variations are related to
the style of mineralisation.
ALS also insert QAQC samples to internally test the quality of the analysis. These results are received with
the assay results in each batch. The ALS QAQC included standards, blanks and duplicates for independent
quality control. The results of the lab standards were also monitored on a batch to batch basis by the data
geologist. The results did not show any issues with the laboratory.
The sample sizes are considered to be appropriate to correctly give an accurate indication of mineralisation
given the qualitative nature of the technique and the style of gold mineralisation sought.
High standard QAQC procedures are in place (and will be audited), therefore repeatability issues from a
QAQC point of view are not considered to be significant.
Significant and/or unexpected intersections were reviewed by alternate company personnel through review
of geological logging data, physical examination of remaining samples and review of digital geological
interpretations.
All assay data was accepted into the database as supplied by the laboratory.
Data importation into the database is documented through standard operating procedures and is guided by
acQuire import validations to prevent incorrect data capture/importation.
Geological, structural and density determination data is directly captured in the database through a
validation controlled interface using Toughbook computers and acquire database import validations.
Primary data is stored in its source electronic form. Assay data is retained in both the original certificate
(.pdf) form and the text files received from the laboratory. Data entry, validation and storage are discussed
in the section on database integrity below.
No adjustments to assay data were undertaken.
Drillhole collars (and drilling foresight/backsight pegs) were set out and picked up by Ausgold personnel
using a differential GPS; which provided +/- 100 millimetre accuracy.
The grid system is MGA94 datum, UTM zone 50. Elevation values were in AHD.

Commentary
An end of hole gyroscopic drill hole survey was completed by the drilling contractors using a Reflex tool. The
gyro measured the first shot at 0m followed by every 10m down-hole. The data was examined and validated
onsite by the supervising geologist. Any surveys that were spurious were re-taken.
Validated surveys are entered into the acQuire data base by data entry personnel.
Ground gravity stations located using Real Time Kinematic GPS accuracy for detailed projects. (+/- 0.5m)
Accurate heights and horizontal coordinates from Kinematic GPS Real Time Kinematic GPS is used. Raw GPS
data is also collected which is post processed to attain the exact location and height of each gravity station.
The Kinematic GPS roving receiver is lightweight and backpackable and can be easily removed from the
vehicle if necessary. An accuracy the order +/- 5 cm is generally achieved relative to the local GDA94 and
Australian Height Datum (AHD).
RC drilling was conducted on 40 and 80 by 100 or 160m spacing.
RC results reported are based on 1m samples for gold within the gneissic units and 4m composite samples
outside the interpreted lodes.

Angled RC drilling (-60 towards 224°) tested the east dipping Jinkas lode (40 – 50°) gneissic foliation as to
minimise bias. At this stage primary mineralisation is assumed to have the same orientation as historic
drilling in the area.
The angled orientation of RC drilling may introduce sampling bias due to any unknown orientation of primary
mineralisation/structures. This would be considered minimal as the mineralisation is largely foliation
parallel.

RC samples are systematically numbered and placed in pre-printed (numbered) calico bags and placed into
numbered polyweave bags which were tied securely and marked with flagging.
Assay samples were stored at a dispatch area and dispatched, depending on the frequency of pickups and
length of the program. Samples were shipped via Katanning Logistics directly to ALS in Perth.
The sample dispatches were accompanied by supporting documentation signed by the geologist and
showing the sample submission number, analysis suite and number of samples.
The chain of custody is maintained by ALS once the samples are received on site and a full audit trail for
every sample is available through the ALS’ Webtrieve application.
Assay results are emailed to the responsible geology administrators in Perth and are loaded into the acQuire
database through an automated process. QAQC on import is completed before the results are finalised.
Before the commencement of the current RC program, the sampling process was fully reviewed and
documented as a standard company process. A number of operational and technical adjustments were
identified to improve validation of collected data, interpretation of data and management of QAQC
practices. These improvements have been updated into standard operating procedures.

Mineral tenement and land tenure status

 Type, reference name/number, location and ownership
including agreements or material issues with third
parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding
royalties, native title interests, historical sites,
wilderness or national park and environmental settings.
 The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting
along with any known impediments to obtaining a
licence to operate in the area.

Reported results are all from 100% owned Ausgold
Exploration Pty Ltd Mining Tenements (wholly owned
subsidiary of Ausgold Limited) M 70/488. The land is used
primarily for grazing and cropping.
The tenement is in good standing, and all work is
conducted under specific approvals from the Department
of Mines and Petroleum (“DMP”).
Apart from reserved areas, rights to surface land use are
held under freehold titles. Ausgold has entered into access
and compensation agreements with freehold landowners
that permit exploration activities.
Written consent under section 18(3) for Jinkas Hill dated
24 January 2018 was granted by Honourable Ben Wyatt

Gold mineralisation was discovered by Otter Exploration
NL in 1979 at Jinkas Hill, Dyliabing, Lone Tree and White
Dam after following up stream sediment anomalies.
Between 1984 and 1988 Otter and related companies
evaluated the region with several other explorers
including South West Gold Mines and Minasco Resources
Pty Ltd.
In 1987 Glengarry Mining NL purchased the project and in
1990 entered into a joint venture with Uranerz who
agreed on minimum payments over three years to earn
50% interest. Uranerz withdrew from the project in 1991
after a decision by their parent company in Germany to
cease Australian operations.

Glengarry Mining NL in 1995 and commenced mining at
the Jinkas deposit in December 1995. Ausgold understands
the mine was closed in 1997 after producing approximately
20,000 oz of gold from the Jinkas and Dingo Hill open cuts
at a head grade of approximately 2.4g/t. In addition, the
mine closure was brought about by a combination of the
low gold price of the time (<US$400/oz) and the inability
of the processing plant’s comminution circuit to process
hard ore from below the base of weathering. Reports from
the period indicate that the ore bodies were reasonably
predictable in terms of grade and continuity and appeared
to produce consistent and reproducible results from grade
control (Ravensgate, 1999).
Great Southern Resources Pty Ltd (“GSR”) purchased the
mining and exploration leases from IMR in August 2000.
Ausgold entered into a joint venture with GSR in August
2010, and the mineral titles were transferred to Ausgold in
entirety in August 2011.

of

The project includes two main deposit areas comprising
Jinkas in the north, and Dingo in the south. The Jinkas
area is further subdivided into a set of mineralised zones.
The majority of the project area is overlain by residual
clays with outcrop mostly limited to remnants of lateritic
duricrust on topographic highs.
Gold mineralisation is hosted by medium to coarsegrained mafic gneisses which dip at around 30° to 45°
towards grid east (68°). These units represent Archaean
greenstones metamorphosed to granulite facies.
The mineralised gneissic units are interlayered with
barren quartz-monzonite sills up to approximately 120
metres thick and are cross-cut by several Proterozoic
dolerite dykes that post-date mineralisation and granulite
metamorphism.
Gold predominantly occurs as free gold associated with
disseminated pyrrhotite and magnetite, lesser pyrite and

Drill hole Information

 A summary of all information material to the
understanding of the exploration results including a
tabulation of the following information for all Material
drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea
level in metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
 If the exclusion of this information is justified on the
basis that the information is not Material and this
exclusion does not detract from the understanding of
the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain
why this is the case.

Data aggregation methods

 In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade
truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off
grades are usually Material and should be stated.
 Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths
of high-grade results and longer lengths of low grade
results, the procedure used for such aggregation should
be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
 The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.

All reported RC and diamond assays have been
arithmetically length weighted. A nominal 0.3g/t Au lower
cut- off is reported with internal waste intervals (i.e. <0.3
g/t) to not exceed the width of a 2m.
Higher grade intervals within larger intersections are
reported as included intervals and noted in results table.
No top-cut off grades have been applied until more assay
results become available to allow statistical
determination.

Relationship between mineralisation widths and
intercept lengths

 These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
 If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the
drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
 If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not known’).

Diagrams

 Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any

The geometry of any primary mineralisation is not known
at present due to the early stage of exploration. The
angled orientation of RC drilling may introduce some
sampling bias (increasing the intercept width of flat lying
or vertical mineralisation). All intersections are
subsequently presented as downhole lengths. If down
hole length varies significantly from known true width
then appropriate notes are provided.

significant discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole
collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
Balanced reporting

 Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of
both low and high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.

Please see information provided in results tables in
Report

Other substantive exploration data

 Other exploration data, if meaningful and material,
should be reported including (but not limited to):
geological observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.

At this stage there is no substantive exploration data from
the recent drilling that is meaningful and material to
report.

Further work

 The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests
for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale
step-out drilling).
 Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible
extensions,
including
the
main
geological
interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this
information is not commercially sensitive.

Further work is discussed in the document in relation to
the exploration results.
