POINTSBET SIGNS WITH BETMAKERS TO OFFER FIXED ODDS RACING
IN NEW JERSEY
9 July 2020 - Melbourne, Australia – PointsBet Holdings Limited (ASX:PBH) (“PointsBet” or
the “Company”) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary PointsBet USA, Inc. has
signed an agreement with BetMakers Technology Group Limited (ASX:BET) (“BetMakers”) to
offer Fixed Odds betting on horseracing in New Jersey, subject to receipt of all necessary
regulatory and other approvals (the “Agreement”).
As announced by BetMakers on February 5, 2020, BetMakers has secured an exclusive 10year agreement with New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen Association and Darby
Development LLC., the operator of Monmouth Park racetrack (“Monmouth”), to deliver and
manage Fixed Odds horseracing into New Jersey.
Under the Agreement, Pointsbet will offer Fixed Odds betting to New Jersey clients on all
Monmouth Park race meetings, with the intention to expand the offering into New Jersey to
include races and vision from other domestic and international jurisdictions, as and when such
content is approved and subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory and other approvals.
The Agreement also provides the option for PointsBet to offer Fixed Odds betting on horse
racing to clients in other US states where PointsBet has market access, via the BetMakers, in
the event that such states have legalised Fixed Odds horse racing betting and the BetMakers
have secured the relevant local approvals.
Sam Swanell, Group CEO and Managing Director said:
“Securing an agreement with BetMakers is a major step in what we believe to be an important
strategy for our US plans. As a Company, we understand thoroughbred, harness and
greyhound racing and we intend to capitalise on the expertise we have gained in Australia as
we roll out racing products into the US market where legal, starting in New Jersey. We see
this as a significant opportunity. Annually, there are twice as many horse races in the US as
there are in Australia, with a much larger total prize pool, however the amount wagered per
capita in the US on horse racing remains a fraction of that in Australia.”
Todd Buckingham, BetMakers CEO said:
“BetMakers sees Pointsbet as a perfect partner to launch Fixed Odds in the US. We have a
great working relationship with Pointsbet, which is one of the fastest growing bookmakers in
Australia and the burgeoning US market.”
