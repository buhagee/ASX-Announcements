FURTHER DERISKS BORBOREMA PROJECT
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

Review of processing plant confirms proposed treatment path and recommends
plant and equipment changes to the comminution and elution circuits.

•

Plant changes will provide additional operational security and benefits and include:
• planned SAG mill circuit to be replaced by three stage crushing and Ball mill;
• AARL elution circuit to be replaced by Pressure Zadra plant.

•

Start up Capital costs reduced to US$90.7M including contingency of US$11.3M.

•

Updated Project Financial Model using a gold price of US$1,550 demonstrates that
the Borborema project will:
• produce 729,400 ounces of gold over the 10.2 year mine life of Stage 1 at,
• an AISC of US$713 per ounce.

•

The Stage 1 project shows an increase of:
• Pre tax NPV (8%) to US$342M (A$496M) and an IRR of 64.7%
• Post tax NPV (8%) to US$287M (A$416M) and an IRR of 57.9%
__________________________________________________________________________________
Big River Gold Ltd (ASX: BRV) (Company or Big River) is pleased to advise shareholders that the review of
the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)1 for the Borborema Project released in December 2019 was completed
as scheduled in June. It resulted in changes to the process design that further de-risks the operation and
provided substantial improvement to the project economics.
Start-up capital costs of the 2Mtpa Project were reduced to US$90.7M which includes contingency of
US$11.33M and the average All In Sustaining Cost (AISC) has seen a significant reduction to US$713 per
ounce gold over the 10.2 years of production scheduled for Stage 1.
Stage 1 is expected to produce 729,400 oz gold over 10.2 years which comprises only a portion of the
Borborema Resource/Reserves of 2.43Moz and 1.61Moz respectively. Refer to ASX announcements of 23
December, 2019 and 6 March, 2018 for more details on reserves and resources.
The pre tax Project NPV (at 8% discount) increased from US$218M to US$342M (A$496M)2 while the after
tax NPV (at 8% discount) increased to US$287M (A$416M).
The updated Project Financial Model used a flat gold price of US1,550 per ounce compared to the 2019
DFS assumption of US$1,400 which remains below the consensus of recent forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg3 and is substantially lower than the current spot price of over US$1,800 per ounce.

Highlights - Review and Update of 2019 DFS
A review of the 2019 DFS concentrated on improving the processing plant and performance. All other
technical and financial aspects of the DFS as described in the ASX announcement dated 23 December, 2019
remain unchanged, including mining, environmental and social aspects.
The review confirmed the suitability of the proposed processing path but recommended changes that were
accepted by the Company to:
•
•

the location and layout of the process plant (now finalised);
the choice of some plant and equipment used in the crushing and grinding circuits and elution
circuit.

It was decided to replace the SAG and ball mill in the comminution circuit as proposed in the 2019 DFS with
a three stage crushing plant and ball mill. This was done to reduce the risk and increase the security of the
operation by minimising the possibility of a long shutdown of the plant caused by a SAG mill equipment
failure and the lack of available spare parts or skilled technicians. It was considered a SAG mill would be
more exposed to this risk than the conventional ball mill.
The selection of a Pressure Zadra plant to replace the proposed AARL elution circuit was made to conserve
water and is considered better suited when operating with the treated sewage water from Currais Novos.
The studies demonstrated that the proposed capital equipment changes will not show a marked difference
in operational performance and may result in improvements as discussed below. They do however, provide
additional security for ongoing operations and the cost estimates indicate some savings in capital
expenditure will be obtained.
Table 1 summarises the revised capital estimates and more details are provided in the following sections.
The revised capital costs were incorporated into the Project Financial Model along with updates to taxation
regimes. Improved taxation rates granted in April by the local authorities on service providers were also
included. Currency exchange rates were largely unchanged except for the Brazilian Real for which an
exchange rate of 0.2000 BRL:USD was assumed that remains more conservative than recent forecasts.

Figure 1 illustrates the production profile during Stage 1 and the drop in AISC in the later years as mining
ceases in the current plan. However, the balance of reserves not scheduled for mining in Stage 1 will be
assessed for possible Stage 2 mine expansions and extension of the mine life beyond Year 10. At this stage
technical and economic studies need to be completed before any decision can be made as to extending
the mine life or repeating the production profile.

Review and Update of 2019 DFS – Detailed Discussion
The following provides detail on the work undertaken between April and June 2020 and conclusions drawn
from reviews of the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) completed by Wave Engineering (Wave) in December
2019. A report titled DFS Changes & Estimate Update was completed in June 2020 by engineering
consultants, CPC Project Design (CPC) following a review of plant layout and water usage by Wave in April
2020.
The work concentrated solely on improving the processing plant and performance. All other technical and
financial aspects of the DFS as described in the ASX announcement dated 23 December, 2019 remain
unchanged, including mining, environmental and social aspects.
The work subsequent to the 2019 DFS completion comprised:
1. Wave completed a first pass concept layout that relocated the process plant and incorporated a 3
stage crushing plant and ball mill to replace the primary crush SAG/ball mill (SAGB) circuit in the
original design.
2. Wave investigating the selection of an AARL elution circuit and elected to replace that with a
Pressure Zadra Plant, thereby lowering both the quality and quantity of water required for the
Project.
3. CPC prepared a DFS Design Changes and Estimate Report with a revised capital cost estimate
including taxes payable on the mechanical and electrical equipment. The revised capital estimate
was of the same order of accuracy as the original DFS.

Plant Location and Layout

For personal use only

The plant site layout and design were reviewed to optimise the site location, layout and earthworks
required which led to:
1. The plant being relocated to:
i) optimise the haulage distance from mine to ROM Pad.
ii) comply with legislation requiring blast zone clearance.
iii) Improve the accuracy of the earthworks requirement and place high load structures on areas
that are cut and not filled (Figure 3). A cut and fill plan shows a revised cut of 157,035m3 from
the topography and required fill of 152,300m3 for a net cut of 4,735m3.
2. A minimisation of the plant footprint to reduce environmental impact and achieve practical
operations
3. The plant layout being redesigned to consider appropriate locations for infrastructure such as
heliport (gold room), substations and Incoming HV Switchyard for improved operations.

Plant Configuration
The review of the plant process design confirmed that the pathway was appropriate for treating the
Borborema ore however, it was decided to change the componentry in two areas of the design:
comminution (crushing and grinding) and elution as illustrated in Figure 9. This change of plant and
equipment was decided upon because they met three essential criteria:
•

They de-risked the project in terms of improved operational reliability, maintenance and servicing
and availability of parts in-country.

•

They maintained and preferably improved operational efficiency and effectiveness, and

•

There was no material increase in capital cost.

Comminution Circuit
CPC were commissioned to incorporate changes to the Wave DFS comprising a three stage crushing and
ball milling circuit in lieu of primary crushing and SAG/Ball milling (SAGB). In Brazil there are considerable
numbers of jaw and cone crushers as well as ball mills and far fewer SAG mills, which are more
sophisticated units. All mechanical units in the crushing circuits are manufactured in Brazil.
In 2019, Orway Mineral Consultants Pty Ltd (OMC) reviewed the testwork in the context of a comminution
circuit and concluded: the Borborema ore is of low to medium competency, with low abrasion, crusher and
rod work indices and above average Bond ball mill work indices. OMC reported there was no major benefit
of using either of the two comminution routes considered.
The pricing of the optional 3-stage crush ball mill circuit showed very little difference in capital and
operating cost over the SAG/Ball option.
The original recommendation for a Primary Crush/SAGB option over a 3-stage crush/ball mill followed
examples in other mining locations where there is considerable advantage in lowering the number of
operating units and therefore labour.
However, the 3-stage crush ball mill circuit is favoured over the SAG/Ball option to reduce operational risk,
because it:
•

Includes multiple plant units available and manufactured in Brazil.

For personal use only

•
•
•
•

Provides for a shorter delivery time than for a SAG mill.
Means only a ball mill is imported. This is a more common occurrence in Brazil with less likely
importation difficulties.
Provides better support, maintenance and availability of spare parts in Brazil than a SAG mill.
Results in less complicated operations and maintenance.

circuit, CIL tanks and fine ore bin/emergency stockpile feeder to the left

Elution and gold room
The elution circuit involves the stripping of gold from the carbon in solution from the CIL tanks. Changes
that included the replacement of the proposed AARL elution circuit with a Pressure Zadra (PZ) plant were
incorporated into this area. There is no discernible difference in layout of an AARL or a pressure Zadra
elution plant in terms of footprint.
AARL elution is more sophisticated and requires more complex valve and piping arrangements than the PZ
as well as a high standard control system. The PZ circuit on the other hand requires longer strip times and
has less flexibility but this is considered manageable without large operating cost imposts.
However, the decision was taken to go with the PZ circuit because the quality of water required for
acceptable AARL elution performance is higher than the PZ circuit which would be better suited to using
purified sewage water from Currais Novos which will have a higher level of organics. The PZ circuit also
uses less water than the AARL circuit which will improve water conservation.

Water supply
Given the proposed changes to the process circuit a review of the required water was undertaken for the
operation. This review confirmed that there is sufficient water for Project requirements in line with the
figures released in the DFS.

CAPITAL ESTIMATE
Tables 3 to 5 below summarise the revised capital cost estimates for plant and mine construction and
compares them to the original 2019 DFS estimate. The total capital cost estimates are within the range of
the level of accuracy of the DFS.
The basis of the cost estimates, including rates for construction, installation, earthworks, concrete, steel
fabrication and mining, remain largely unchanged from the 2019 DFS. Where plant or equipment changed
budget pricing has been obtained from suitable suppliers and/or based on pricing achieved in very recent
projects.
The capital cost estimates include the relevant taxation on purchase, importation and installation and also
incorporates those benefits where the company receives an exemption on capital items that cannot be
sourced in Brazil or has been granted reduced taxation rates. The ISSQN municipal tax on services was also
recently reduced from 5% to 2% due to the importance of the project in the region and forecast levels of
employment and has a significant and direct effect on costs of installation and contract services supplied.
The total capital cost has decreased by US$8,622,300 to US$90,708,600 including contingency of
US$11,333,800.

PROJECT FINANCIAL MODEL
Macroeconomic Assumptions
Gold Price used: US$1,550 per ounce.
Since the release of the 2019 DFS the gold price and outlook has strengthened considerably and judging
from several forecasts the outlook remains positive. An assessment of past gold price performance and
recent forecast over the next few years supports the decision by BRV to increase the gold price assumption
in the Project Financial Model from US$1,400 per ounce.

11

For personal use only

Recent gold price forecasts over the next four years were taken from forecasts completed by Bloomberg
(11 June, 2020) for which the average consensus forecast (outliers removed) ranged from US$1,604 to
US$1,705 per ounce.
However, for conservatism the Company has elected to use a flat US$1,550 per ounce which is less than
the average consensus of recent forecasts and substantially less than current spot prices.
Taxation
The Borborema Project is situated in a region of Brazil that makes it eligible for the Sudene tax concession
scheme which can reduce the company taxation rate to 15%. In addition, imported items that cannot be
produced or acquired in Brazil are exempt from import tax and these exemptions have been applied to
eligible plant and equipment in the capital estimation and financial model.
In April 2020, as an indication of the level of government support the Project receives, the ISSQN municipal
tax on services (similar to a VAT) was reduced from 5% to 2% for those projects such as Borborema which
employ over 100 people.
All relevant taxes have been applied where appropriate to the cashflow model.
Currency Exchange rates
A number of currency exchange rates used for capital and operating costs are summarised in Table 5. Most
are largely unchanged from the 2019 DFS except the Brazilian Real (BRL) but the assumed exchange rate
remains conservative when compared to recent forecasts by financial institutions compiled by Bloomberg
(11 June, 2020).

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the key financial drivers of the project. These and their
respective impacts on the project in terms of NPV are shown in Figure 9. Table 8 shows the impact of a
changing gold price on financial indicators and drivers.
The variables that have the greatest impact on the NPV of the Project are ore grade and factors affecting
gold price and recovery. The major sensitivities are revenue affecting, indicating the risk to the Project
economics is most leveraged to the gold price or quantity of gold sold.

About Big River Gold
Big River Gold Ltd (ASX:BRV), is a mineral exploration and development company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
Its major focus is the 2.43M ounce Borborema Gold Project in Brazil; a country the Company believes is underexplored and
offers high potential for the discovery of world class mineral deposits.

Borborema Gold Project
Borborema is a project with a resource of 2.43Moz gold, located in the Seridó area of the Borborema province in northeastern Brazil. It is 100% owned by Big River and consists of three mining leases covering a total area of 29 km2 including
freehold title over the main prospect area.
The Project benefits from a favourable taxation regime, existing on-site facilities and excellent infrastructure such as
buildings, grid power, water and sealed roads. It is close to major cities and regional centres and the services they can
provide.

Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)
A DFS for development and construction of Stage 1 of the Borborema Project was completed in December 2019 as detailed
in the ASX Announcement of 23 December, 2019. It confirmed the project’s strong economics and optimised a profitable
open pit with a mine life of more than 10 years producing approximately 729,000 ounces gold at a C1 cash cost of US$534/oz
and AISC of US$713/oz.
Assuming a gold price of US$1,550 per ounce, the pre-tax NPV (8%) returned US$342M with an IRR of 64.7%. The project
returns an average EBITDA of US$72M pa.

Indicated Resources within the pit designs, after
allowing for ore loss.
The mining method selected is open pit, selective
mining of ore and adjacent waste on nominal 5m
benches using a face shovel or backhoe excavator.
Bulk waste will be mined on 10m benches. Pit
ramps are designed at a 10% gradient and 15m

Resources within the pit shell selected for the final
pit design was only 1.4% of the contained
Resources.
The MIK Resource model is a recoverable model
and no additional mining dilution has been added.
Mining recovery allows for a 2% ore loss.
A minimum mining width at the pit base was 20m
however the mineralization horizontal width is
mostly greater than 20m.
Inferred Resources within the pit design contains
only 1.4% of total gold resources and has not been
considered for Ore Reserve estimates.
Infrastructure required for the open pit mining
operations will comprise mining workshop, mining
office, fuel and explosives storage.
The metallurgical process proposed is conventional
carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold extraction.
All metallurgical processes proposed are all welltested technology and appropriate for the styles of
mineralisation.
Extensive metallurgical testwork has been
undertaken and included:
o
Preliminary Mineralogy.
o
Column leach tests.
o
Bottle roll tests.
o
Flotation tests.
o
Leach kinetic tests.
o
Gravity concentration.
o
Settling tests.
o
Bond Work Index.
o
Cyanide Neutralization.
o
Grinding pilot plant study.
o
Tailings filtration
Metallurgical domaining is into oxides and fresh
mineralization, as defined in the Mineral Resource
model.
Gold recoveries are between 93 and 96%
depending on the feed grade. Silver recovery after
24 hours is approximately 51%.
No deleterious elements have been identified.
Results of the testwork indicate that Borborema
material is suitable for grinding in Semi-Autogenous
mills and there is unlikely to be a need for pebble
crushing to be included. A pilot scale grinding
testing programme was established to obtain data
that was used as a basis for performing grinding
circuit simulations.
The major studies incorporated by the
Environmental
Impact

(EIA)
and
Environmental Impact Report (RIMA) included the

Archeological inventory survey.
Geochemical testing has shown that the Borborema
tailings and waste rock are geochemically inert. The
results from static geochemical testing and on-site
geochemical kinetic testing completed over a
period of 2 years show no alkaline drainage risk and
no ARD risk from the waste samples. Also, the
kinetic cells have not exhibited metals leaching of
significant concern.
Cascar has received the critical Pre‐Licence (Licença
Previa or ‘LP’) for its Borborema Gold Project from
the Rio Grande do Norte State Government
Environmental Department (IDEMA).
This is
approval of the EIA, based on the reduced project
footprint for stage 1 of the project and dry stacked
tailings.
The Installation License (LI) was also approved in
April 2019 by IDEMA
Infrastructure is excellent with a sealed highway
beside the project area, two existing 230kV power
lines, waste water is available from the nearby town
of Currais Novos.
All the land area required for stage 1 of the project
is owned by Cascar.
Currais Novos, population ~45,000, is located 30 km
west of the project and provides a full range of
commercial services, banking facilities, hotel
accommodation, potential staff accommodation,
schooling and basic medical and hospital facilities.
Capital costs were estimated by Wave International
and other feasibility study contributors in 2019 as
part of the DFS for a 2Mtpa process plant. Capital
costs included the mining fleet, mine preproduction costs, process facilities, site
infrastructure, tailings filtration, utilities and
support facilities and a contingency and totaled
USD99M.
DFS operating costs for mining, treatment and G&A
were derived from first principles by GE21 (mining),
Wave (treatment and services) and Cascar (G&A).
In November 2019 the average mining cost was
estimated at US$2.72/t mined and the average mill
throughput cost (processing plus G&A) was
US$12.89t milled.
As the revenue from gold sales is effectively
received in US$ exchange rates for the Brazilian
Real and to a much lesser extent other currencies
have been used at the prevailing public mid-rate
when costs have been estimated.
Transportation and local freight costs have been
provided by international and local suppliers as part
of the estimation of capital and operating costs and
are well established for projects in Brazil.
Off-site refining costs have been based on typical
rates prevailing in Brazil and are within a small

range for refining of bars of gold doré.
The royalty paid to the Brazilian government will be
1.5% of gross revenue. There are no other royalties
payable.
Revenue is based on a US$ gold price and the
BRL:USD exchange rate at a specific time to derive
the BRL gross revenue/oz. For the DFS, this was
US$1,400/oz and a BRL:USD rate of 4.17:1 or
BRL5,838/oz.
No revenue was allowed for silver as it is not
material.

The market for gold is well established and liquid
and the price has varied in recent times from a high
of around US$1,800/oz in 2011-2012 to a low of
around US$1,070 in December 2015. The spot price
of gold at the end of December 2019 was
US$1,510/oz.
No formal market assessment or forecast for the
gold price or silver price has been undertaken.

The main tool used for the analysis is an Excel-based
discounted cash-flow model used by Wave,
including full allowance for all taxes, sustaining
capital and mine closure costs. Revenue, exchange
rates and key cost inputs were as covered above.
The discount rate used in the 2019 DFS was 8%.
An NPV of US$203M post tax was estimated based
on all key inputs adjusted for November 2019. The
project is most sensitive to revenue (gold price, ore
grade, BRL:USD exchange rate and processing
recovery).
Strong support for the project has been received
from both the environmental agency, local
municipal council, the State Government of Rio
Grande do Norte and the local community, as
demonstrated with the approval of the EIA. (refer
ASX release 20 April 2017) and granting of both LP
and LI.
No material naturally occurring risks have been
identified.
No material legal or marketing agreements are
required to be entered into.
With the key environmental licenses now received,
Cascar will work to fulfil the standard conditions of
the LP, which have largely already been achieved.
Work will also comply with the granted “Installation
Licence” (Licença de Instalação or LI).

No Measured Resources have been classified as
Probable Reserves.
GE21 has reviewed the portion of the Ore Reserve
that is part of the Stage 1 development.
As detailed above the Ore Reserve has been based
on the draft 2013 feasibility study, subsequent work
and the work completed as part of the DFS for Stage
1 of the project. All aspects of the Project are
currently at least to a Pre-Feasibility Study level of
accuracy and confidence.
The Modifying Factors included consideration of
mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure,
economic, gold price, legal, environmental, social
and governmental factors as detailed in sections
above. The Project viability is most susceptible to
gold price.
The previous production data of heap leach
operations in the 1980’s and 1990’s is very limited
