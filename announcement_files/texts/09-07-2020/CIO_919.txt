CIO EXTENDS EXISTING CONVERTIBLE NOTES
Connected IO Limited (“CIO” or “Company”) is pleased to announce all but 4 of the existing
convertible noteholders have agreed to extend their facility for a further 12 months. As a
result, 19 of the 23 have extended equating to $1,141,000 of the total $1,321,000 face value
of all the convertible notes.
The extension means that the Company will not be obligated to repay the face value of these
convertible notes before 30 June 2021. The status of the remaining unextended convertible
noteholders are still subject to ongoing negotiations with the Company. CIO appreciates the
continued support of its convertible noteholders who have expressed by their extension great
confidence in the development and continuing growth of the Company’s business.
