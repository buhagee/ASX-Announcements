DRILLING COMMENCED AT ROCKY DAM
HIGHLIGHTS
• 860m, 9-hole RC drilling program has commenced at Rocky Dam
• Drilling designed to expand upon shallow oxide mineralisation (including 9m @ 1.7 g/t Au) and
test for a west dipping bedrock lode
• Assay results are expected in August 2020
Dreadnought Resources Limited (“Dreadnought”) is pleased to announce that a 9 hole, 860m RC
drilling program has commenced at the Rocky Dam Gold-VMS Project.
The drill program is following up on shallow oxide intercepts at CRA-North of up to 45m @ 0.6g/t Au
from 18m, including 9m @ 1.7g/t Au. The program will test ~200m of strike length centred on previous
drill intercepts and a large soil anomaly. In addition, the program will also test for a west dipping
bedrock lode which was interpreted from the previous program.
The program is expected to be completed mid-July 2020 with assays expected during August 2020.
Dreadnought Managing Director, Dean Tuck, commented: “Dreadnought is excited to be back out at
Rocky Dam to follow up on our encouraging shallow oxide intercepts. In addition to this program,
Dreadnought has results pending from the 1m splits from the previous CRA-North drilling. Assay results
from the recent Illaara Gold-VMS will also be released over the coming weeks.”

Background on CRA-North (100%)
CRA-North was defined by CRA in the 1990s as a 700m long gold anomaly along a sheared contact of
felsic volcanics and black shales. This work included shallow RAB drilling (average depth 24m) and two
diamond holes (average depth 200m). The diamond drilling appears to have been ineffective with
down hole surveys indicating a significant change off planned azimuth by 30°.
The recent program tested a high tenor gold-in-soil anomaly located along a sheared contact between
felsic volcanics and sediments to confirm the orientation of the mineralised structure. Three sections
of scissor holes were drilled either side of the gold-in-soil and historical RAB drilling intercepts. An
additional hole was drilled to the south to test thin east-west trending quartz veins exposed during
earthworks. In total, 7 holes for 1,212m were drilled along 300m of strike.
Drill results included the following (see figures 2 and 3):
-

RDRC002: 45m of 0.6g/t Au including 9m @ 1.7g/t Au from 18m depth
RDRC006: 40m @ 0.2 g/t Au from 19m depth

The gold intercepts were associated with gossanous quartz veins in felsic schists and black shales
within the oxidised lower saprolite and saprock weathering zones. These oxide intercepts are likely
associated with a main lode which is interpreted to be dipping off to the west and plunging north
which is in line with the prospect scale foliation.

Background on Rocky Dam (100%)
Rocky Dam currently comprises a single granted tenement and 5 tenement applications covering
~115sq kms around the Yindarlgooda Dome within the Eastern Goldfields. The project is located only
45kms east of Kalgoorlie close to significant mining infrastructure and surrounded by active explorers.
Rocky Dam consists of mafic volcanics in the east and felsic-intermediate volcanics and volcaniclastics
in the west with exhalative pyritic chert ridges and an unconformable epiclastic basin to the north.
Rocky Dam is a favourable setting for gold and base metal rich VMS styles of mineralisation.

INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS
Kimberley Ni-Cu-Au Projects
Dreadnought controls the second largest land
holding in the highly prospective West
Kimberley region of WA. The main project
area, Tarraji-Yampi, is located only 85kms from
Derby and has been locked up as a Defence
reserve since 1978. The area was only recently
opened
under
the
Commonwealth
Government’s co-existence regime that
balances Defence’s needs with the
requirements of others including Aboriginal
groups, the resources industry, pastoralists
and State Governments.
Tarraji-Yampi presents a rare first mover
opportunity
with known outcropping
mineralisation and historic workings from the
early 1900s which have seen no modern
exploration.
Three styles of mineralisation occur at TarrajiYampi including: volcanogenic massive sulphide (“VMS”); Proterozoic Cu-Au (“IOCG”); and magmatic
sulphide Ni-Cu-PGE. Numerous high priority nickel, copper and gold drill targets have been identified
from recent VTEM surveys, historical drilling and surface sampling of outcropping mineralisation.
Illaara Gold & VMS Project
Illaara is located 190km northwest of Kalgoorlie in the Yilgarn Craton and covers 75kms of strike along
the Illaara Greenstone Belt. Illaara is prospective for typical Archean mesothermal lode gold deposits
and base metals VMS mineralisation.
Dreadnought has consolidated the Illaara Greenstone Belt mainly through an acquisition from
Newmont. Newmont defined several camp-scale targets which were undrilled due to a change in
corporate focus. Prior to Newmont, the Illaara Greenstone Belt was predominantly held by iron ore
explorers and has seen minimal gold and base metal exploration since the 1990s. Illaara contains
several drill ready gold targets. In addition, the Eastern and Western VMS Horizons are expected to
produce exciting drill targets with the application of modern exploration technology.
Rocky Dam Gold & VMS Project
Rocky Dam is located 45kms east of Kalgoorlie in the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane of Western
Australia. Rocky Dam is prospective for typical Archean mesothermal lode gold deposits and Cu-Zn
VMS mineralisation. Rocky Dam has known gold and VMS occurrences with drill ready gold targets
including the recently defined CRA-North Gold Prospect.
