Free milling, high gold recovery, low energy and low reagent consumption
metallurgical program confirms strong economic potential of Abujar Gold Project

Highlights:
 Independent metallurgical testwork completed on samples from Tietto’s 2.2Moz
Abujar Gold Project demonstrates highly favourable characteristics for low‐cost
processing including:
 Free milling ores ‐ very high gravity gold and CIL gold recoveries delivering
up to 98‐99% overall gold recoveries
 High gold recovery at coarse grind sizes ranging from 96% (180 µm) to 98%
(106 µm) for fresh ore
 Notable low energy and low reagent requirements
 Simple flowsheet ‐ single‐stage crusher with SAG mill circuit (SSAG) with
gravity and CIL for gold recovery
 Testwork completed on representative samples from the Abujar‐Gludehi deposit
(AG) which hosts Abujar’s high‐grade core of 19.3Mt @ 2.2 g/t Au for 1.38Moz
 Tietto has engaged Mintrex, a reputable engineering consultant, to manage
metallurgy and plant design for PFS
 Mintrex most recently worked on the Sanbrado Gold Project for West African
Resources, and other major clients include Regis Resources, Northern Star,
AngloGold and Evolution Mining
 50,000m Abujar drilling program continues utilising Company‐owned rigs
 Tietto on track to deliver updated Mineral Resource in Q3 2020 and PFS in Q1 2021
West African gold explorer and developer Tietto Minerals Limited (ASX: TIE) is pleased to
report completion of the metallurgical test program on selected diamond drill core from the
Abujar‐Gludehi (AG) gold deposit, part of its 2.2Moz Abujar Gold Project, in Côte d’Ivoire,
West Africa, which will now allow the Company to commence the Abujar Pre‐Feasibility
Study.
Tietto Managing Director, Dr Caigen Wang, said:
“The completion of the metallurgical program has delivered us a quadrella; free milling at
coarse grind sizes, very high gravity and CIL gold recoveries, low energy and low reagent
consumption and a simple process flowsheet.”

“Mintrex and ALS have done a great job delivering the results of the study in a timely
manner, despite the imposition of COVID 19 hygiene requirements. As such, we are on a
great footing to move seamlessly into the PFS phase of work.”
“Abujar is known for consistently delivering high‐gold grades from our exploration drilling
including the high‐grade core at AG (19.3Mt @ 2.2 g/t Au for 1.38Moz) and now it is also
delivering outstanding metallurgical results. We believe that Abujar has the potential to be a
sizeable standalone open pit mining operation located close to major infrastructure in a
supportive mining jurisdiction.”
“I am also pleased to advise our shareholders that we have engaged Mintrex in Perth to
manage metallurgy and plant design for the feasibility study.”
“Drilling continues at Abujar and we remain on schedule for delivery of an updated resource
in Q3 2020. This updated Mineral Resource and results from the metallurgical testwork
program will underpin our PFS which is scheduled for delivery in Q1 2021.”
Metallurgical Testwork
Samples were divided into nine composites on the basis of their ore type (oxide, transitional
and fresh ores) and their proximity. Table 1 identifies the nine composites.

Physical Testwork
The physical properties of the Abujar ores allow Tietto to consider a lower cost, simple
flowsheet utilising single‐stage crushing with SAG mill circuit (SSAG) given the high gold
recoveries obtained at coarser grind sizes (>106 µm) and excellent physical testwork results
(Table 2), demonstrating gold mineralisation at AG is not abrasive and is of medium to
moderate hardness:

Grind Size Testwork
Gravity amalgamation testwork established significant gravity gold in almost all composites
(including Fresh 1 and Variability Fresh 2, the two samples for the optimisation testwork).
The samples were quite “spotty”, having particles of free gold throughout; meaning the
grade of the composites was quite variable. This led to the addition of a gravity recovery
step which was added before each leach optimisation test.
The selected composites (Fresh 1 and Var Fresh 2) were ground to four particle sizes – 180
µm, 150 µm, 106 µm and 75 µm. Subsequently, samples were gravity separated, the
concentrate measured and the tails leached under standard cyanidation conditions. Results
are shown in Table 3 . Overall recovery after 24 hours was broadly between 94‐99%.

The gravity concentrate was subjected to intensive leach testwork and the results show that
for the Fresh‐1 composite, about 86% of the gold was recovered to the gravity concentrate,
of which >99% was extracted in the intensive leach. About 78% of the gold in the VAR
Fresh‐2 was recovered to the gravity concentrate, with >99% extracted in the intensive
leach.
Leach Optimisation Testwork
This stage of testwork focussed on optimising the conditions for leaching the gold from the
ore by cyanidation including detailed gravity separation testwork. The effect of various
conditions and parameters on gold recovery during leaching were then examined using the
selected samples. Leaching optimisation tests on two fresh samples found that the leaching
process was relatively simple and robust:
 Optimum Grind size ‐ size between 106 µm and 150 µm;\
 Use of air or oxygen sparging (ore is not an oxygen consumer)
 Oxygen uptake rate ‐consumption of oxygen by the reaction is minimal and
thus the ore is a very low oxygen consumer
 Addition of lead nitrate was not necessary
 Inclusion of carbon in the leaching vessel has a minor positive effect on total
gold recovery ‐ calculated head grade and assay grade matched well for
these tests, which indicates that the composites do not have any significant
preg‐robbing characteristics
 The optimised leaching process consumed of 0.2‐0.3 kg/t of cyanide. Lime
consumption was around 0.2 kg/t for the fresh domain, 0.6 kg/t for the
transitional sample and 2.7 kg/t for the oxide
 The total gold recovery including gravity and leaching was between 95.5‐
99%

Appointment of Mintrex for PFS/DFS
Following the successful completion of the metallurgical test program, the Company has
subsequently appointed Mintrex to manage the metallurgy and design of the Abujar
Processing Plant for the feasibility study.
“Mintrex has extensive capabilities in gold processing including metallurgy, process design,
infrastructure, study and project management and project valuation. Our experienced team
of consultants has worked on greenfields and brownfields gold projects in a diverse range of
geological and geographical environments. We are proud of our design of an extensive
range of operating processing gold plants mostly in Australia and Africa.”
Mintrex most recently worked on the Sanbrado Gold Project for West African Resources,
and other major clients include Regis Resources, Northern Star, AngloGold and Evolution
Mining.
Next Steps
Tietto’s fully funded 50,000m drill program continues, aiming to increase the resource
inventory of existing deposits as well as identifying new prospects within the Abujar
Project’s 70km‐long gold corridor, of which 90% of strike length remains to be tested.
Tietto’s Company‐owned diamond drill rigs continue to deliver high production rates at
some of the lowest exploration costs in the gold sector. This ensures a steady flow of drill
results which will be incorporated into an Abujar resource update scheduled for Q3 2020,
building on the existing 2.2Moz gold resource.
Tietto is advancing project studies necessary for delivery of a PFS in Q1 2021 and will report
on progress as results become available.
The Company expects to report further drilling results in the coming weeks.

Abujar Gold Project, Côte d’Ivoire
The Abujar Gold Project is located approximately 30km from the major regional city of Daloa
in central‐western Côte D’Ivoire. It is close to good regional and local infrastructure to
facilitate exploration and development being only 15km from nearest tarred road and grid
power.
The Abujar Gold Project is comprised of three contiguous tenements, Middle, South and
North tenement, with a total land area of 1,114km2, of which less than 10% has been
explored. It features an NNE‐orientated gold corridor over 70km striking across three
tenements.
JORC Statement of Mineral Resources
Results of the independent Mineral Resources estimate for the Project are tabulated in the
Statement of Mineral Resources in below, which are reported in line with both the
requirements of the 2012 JORC Code; as such the Statement of Mineral Resources is
suitable for public reporting. The Statement of Mineral Resources shown in Table 4.
Mineral Resources are reported at a cut‐off grade of 0.4 Au g/t within a pit shell based on a
gold price of 1,800 USD per troy ounce, and 0.8 Au g/t below the pit shell. The cut‐off
grades were based on estimated mining and processing costs and recoveries factors of
similar projects in the Ivory Coast.
Table 4: Statement of Mineral Resources by Deposit as at 11 November, 2019 Reported at 0.4 g/t Au cut off within pit

Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria
JORC Code explanation
Sampling techniques Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as downhole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done
this would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg
was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’).
In other cases, more explanation may be required, such
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may
warrant disclosure of detailed information.

Commentary
The drilling completed prior to March 2018 has been conducted with a
multiple purpose drill rig using Reverse Circulation (RC) techniques for
collar of each hole and Diamond Drilling (DD) techniques for the tail of
some deep hole. In general, the RC to DD switch point is at around 120‐
150m hole depth. Holes are angled to optimally intersect mineralised
zones. All RC and DD samples were weighed to determine recoveries. All
potentially mineralised zones were then split and sampled at 1m intervals
using three‐tier riffle splitters. DD core were cut at the camp site of the
Abujar project. QA/QC procedures were completed as per industry best
practice standards (certified blanks and standards and duplicate
sampling). In general, 2m RC composite samples and 0.5‐1.67m DD half
core were despatched to ALS Lab in Yamoussoukro for sample
preparation, where they were crushed, dried and pulverised to produce a
sub pulps for fire assay. The pulps were then sent to ALS’s assay Lab in
Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) or Kumasi (Ghana) where 50g fire assays,
AAS finishes and screen fire assays have been conducted. Following a
review of results for intervals where visible gold had been observed in
drill core. Pulps from some of the DD holes that had been prepared at ALS
Yamoussoukro Lab were sent to Intertek Ghana for check assaying which
involved a re‐assay of three times on each pulp.
The new assay results for RC samples and AC samples reported in this
announcement are from RC holes drilled by AMS’s RC600 rig and AC holes
drilled by AMS’s truck mounted aircore rig.
The new assay results for DD samples reported in this announcement are
from DD holes drilled by the Company owned portable diamond drill rig.
Intertek Lab’s truck picked up all samples from the Abujar Project site and

prepared/analysed the samples in Intertek lab in Ghana. Fire assay are
used for all AC, RC and DD samples.
All AC and RC samples are 2m composite.
Reverse Circulation “RC” drilling within the exploration area comprises 5
1/8‐inch diameter face sampling hammer.
Diamond drilling within the exploration area prior to 31st March 2018
comprises NQ sized core.
The RC‐DD holes drilled prior to 31st March 2018 normally had RC to DD
switch point at around 120‐150m hole depth.
The DD holes in the current drilling programs are being drilled by the
Company’s own portable hydraulic diamond drill rig. DD holes are drilled
in HQ size from collar to the point where fresh rock is reached which is
approximately 20‐40m deep (inclined depth at ‐50°). In fresh rock, the DD
holes are drilled in NTW size of 75.7mm with core diameter of 56.1mm.
The AC holes were drilled with a drill bit of 3.5 inches.
Diamond core was reconstructed into continuous runs; marking depths
were checked against the depths marked on core blocks.
RC recoveries are logged and recorded in the database. Overall recoveries
are >75% for the RC; there are no significant sample recovery problems. A
technician is always present at the rig to monitor and record recovery. A
cyclone and splitter were used to provide a uniform sample and were
routinely cleaned. Tietto employees managed sampling to ensure correct
sampling practices. RC samples were visually checked for recovery,
moisture and contamination. A booster was used when drilling wet
holes, to maintain dry samples each wet hole was purged after a rod
change and before the commencement of drilling the next rod.
Core recoveries were generally good with above 90% average recovery.
As the mineralised zone is generally silicified and competent, core loss
was not observed to be an issue over the mineralised zones. No
significant bias is expected, and any potential bias is not considered
material.

Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size
of the material being sampled.

Tietto uses specifically designed log sheets to capture all geological data.
During logging, part of the RC sample is washed, logged and placed (using
glue) to chip boards meter by meter, which are stored on site.
Geotechnical logging was carried out on all diamond drill holes for
recovery, RQD and number of defects (per interval). Information on
structure type, dip, dip direction, alpha angle, beta angle, texture, shape,
roughness and fill material are stored in the structure/Geotech table of
the database. Logging of diamond core and RC samples recorded
lithology, mineralogy, mineralisation, structural (DDH only), weathering,
alteration, colour and other features of the samples. Core was
photographed in both dry and wet form. All drilling has been logged to a
standard that is appropriate for inclusion in any future Mineral Resource
estimation or mining studies and metallurgical studies.
Diamond core sampling intervals were based on lithological or alteration
boundary contacts, with a minimum down hole length of 0.5 and
maximum of 1.55m. The core was photographed, logged, cut and half
core was sent for assay. Sampling of RC holes was completed on 1‐metre
downhole intervals, but 2‐metre composite samples were created and
assayed; bulk samples were taken from the cyclone meter by meter by
Tietto field assistants and split through a three‐tier Jones riffle splitter to
collect two 6.5kg samples. Every attempt was made to ensure that the
splitter that was used was in good condition, level and that the splitter
was cleaned with compressed air after each sample was passed through it
to minimise contamination. Every effort was made to ensure that
samples were sampled dry. Field QAQC procedures included the insertion
of field duplicates and commercial standards. Field duplicates were
inserted at 15m intervals or where mineralisation was anticipated, and
Standards were inserted at 30m intervals (every 15 RC samples for 2m
composite RC samples). Approximately 1:15 RC field duplicates were
taken from 1m riffle split samples at the rig. Sample sizes are considered
to be appropriate to accurately represent the gold mineralisation at

All samples from drilling prior to the end of March 2018 were assayed at
ALS laboratories either in Ouagadougou or Kumasi depending on LAS lab’s
working loads using 50g fire assay and an atomic absorption
spectrometer (AAS) finish which is considered a near total assaying
technique if completed properly. This method is appropriate and returns
accurate and precise values for gold. Field QAQC procedures included the
insertion of field duplicates and commercial standards. The laboratory
inserted feldspar flushes, standards, repeats and duplicates. Repeat or
duplicate analysis for samples (assayed in the past three years) showed
that the precision of samples is within acceptable limits. However, pulps
from DD core samples with visible gold were re‐assayed in Intertek Ghana
with three repeats and the average results for these samples were
reported.
All samples from drilling after March 2018 are assayed at Intertek Lab in
Ghana.
Several independent personnel visually verified intersections in diamond
core and RC chips as well as trenches and outcrops. Primary data was
collected using a set of company standard Excel templates on Toughbook
laptop computers using lookup codes. The geo‐information was validated
on‐site by the Company’s database technicians and then validated and
merged into a final database by the company’s database manager.
Drill hole collar locations as reported have been picked‐up using a Garmin
GPS. Final locations will come from a pickup by a surveyor using a total
station. Downhole surveying was completed by the drilling contractor
using a Reflex EZ‐shot Downhole Survey instrument prior to the end of
March 2018. All drill holes have been located using UTM grid WGS84

Commentary
The Abujar Project hosts three exploration licences, the Abujar South Exploration
License (“Issia Licence”, 390.5 km2, , to which Tietto holds a 100% interest), the
Abujar Middle Exploration License (“Zoukougbeu Licence”, 383.5 km2, to which
Tietto holds a 90% interest through the licence holding company Tiebaya Gold Sarl)
and the Abujar North Exploration License (“Zahibo Licence”, 340 km2, to which
Tietto holds a 15% interest through the licence holding company Gail Exploration
Sarl, with the right to acquire a further 65% interest. Currently, Tietto and Gail are
in the process of legalizing Tietto’s 50% interest in this tenement.), which together,
cover an area of 1,114 km2.
The Issia Licence was granted on 22 March 2017. The Zoukougbeu Licence was
granted on 15 September 2014 and is at the final approval process stage of 3‐year
extension. The Zahibo Licence was granted on 6 May 2015
All exploration licences have an initial tenure of 4 years with two entitled extension
of 3 years each plus a special extension of 2 years, for a total of up to 12‐year
tenure.
All licences are granted for gold. All fees have been paid, and the permits are valid.
The ownership of mineral lease rights in Côte d’Ivoire is governed primarily by the
Law n°2014‐138 dated on March 24 2014 (Côte d’Ivoire Mining Code). If the
exploration licences were to be subsequently converted into Mining Licences, the
Government of Cote d’Ivoire would hold a 10% share of the permit and Tietto
would hold 90%, 85% and 80% for the Abujar South, Abujar Middle and Abujar
North, respectively.
