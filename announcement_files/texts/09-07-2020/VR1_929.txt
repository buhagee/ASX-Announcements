Mindesk: Strategy Overview
Aligned with its overarching strategy, in a coordinated effort to strengthen its overall market
proposition, Vection Technologies has implemented a strategy aimed at repositioning its ﬂagship
real-time software Mindesk and FrameS.
Under the new software market positioning, Mindesk will be the Company’s real-time software
focussed on enterprise technical product design, engineering and development, while FrameS will
be positioned as the Company’s solution to connect manufacturers’ design data to the
manufacturing ﬂoor and to their clients.
Mindesk: Product and Marketing Strategy
Exiting the beta phase, in 2020 the Company launched the commercial version of the new Mindesk
uniﬁed real-time software suite, called Mindesk 2020.

2,310
unique accounts

The cumulative number of unique
accounts at the end of June 2020 has
reached 2,310 in more than 100 countries,
representing a diversiﬁed and global user
base with a predominance in developed
markets in Europe and North America.

To date, due to the signiﬁcant development and ﬁne tuning of the platform, Mindesk’s marketing
strategy has relied solely on face-to-face and word-of-mouth interaction, with accounts growing
steadily at ~7% per month during the past year.
Following this, the Company has commenced small scale investment in paid marketing activities to
identify the right market proposition to ensure optimum market adoption:
●

●

Initially, Mindesk has been promoted on the unique Food4Rhino portal (food4rhino.com),
where the Rhino Computer Aided Software (CAD) software plugins can be discovered and
downloaded
Subsequently, the Company will undertake its ﬁrst steps in paid promotion across
professional media outlets including Linkedin, YouTube (with relevant video) and specialised
industry press.

This marketing strategy will seek to maximise software exposure leading to greater opportunities
for monetisation of new and existing user base.

Mindesk: Development Strategy Overview
During the coming week, the Company will release Mindesk 2020.2, where both the Rhino and
SolidWorks versions will see the implementation of multiple landmark features designed around
users’ feedback, bringing to market a strong value proposition for new and existing users aimed at
increasing paying customers’ conversion rates.
Aligned with this overarching strategy, Vection Technologies is focusing on establishing Mindesk as

between the most popular CAD platforms, VR/AR headsets and the most popular graphic engines
aligned with its stated commitment on building an interconnected, 360° real-time software product
suite.

are producing initial encouraging results.
Today, Vection Technologies is able to embrace enterprises' full value chain with our an
interconnected, 360° real-time software product suite. The new Mindesk offering is being conveyed
through a wider, worldwide marketing effort. We look forward to further expand our offer through the
integration of partner products and to build the leading XR ecosystem for real-time design.
