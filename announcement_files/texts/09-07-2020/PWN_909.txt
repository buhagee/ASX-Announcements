PROJECTS
Advancement & Rationalisation of Mining Project Portfolio

June 2020 Quarterly Report

| 4

For personal use only

Parkway Minerals currently holds an equity interest in two mining exploration projects (outlined
below), with the interest in the third project (DTP), recently relinquished. During the quarter no
substantive mining exploration activities occurred in relation to these projects.

i)

i.

Karinga Lakes Potash Project (KLPP), acquired 15%, right to earn 40%,

ii.

New Mexico Lithium Project (NMLP), acquired 70%, right to earn 100%, and

iii.

Dandaragan Trough Project (DTP), hold 0%, divested during the quarter.
>> A summary of each of these projects is outlined below, with details of the relevant
tenements outlined in the Tenement Interests table at the end of this report.
Karinga Lakes Potash Project (KLPP, 15% interest, earning 40%)

The KLPP is a JV with Verdant Minerals in the Northern Territory (Figure 1). Consolidated
Potash Corporation Pty Ltd (CPC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) acquired an
initial 15% interest in the KLPP by completing a scoping study in February 2019. On 11 May
2020, Parkway Minerals announced the commencement of a pre-feasibility study (PFS) on
the project based on the strategic application of the aMES™ technology.
>> Details of the KLPP-PFS are outlined above in the aMES™ Technology Platform
section at the beginning of this report.
The operator of the project, Verdant Minerals is currently undertaking a tenement
rationalisation process focused on holding essentially a similar project area, by consolidating
exploration tenure from 7 to 3 contiguous licences, therefore simplifying dealings with relevant
stakeholders as well as potentially reducing holding costs. Parkway Minerals has been
advised by the operator that the Northern Territory Government’s intention to rely on the
expedited procedure for assessing the grant of the new exploration licences has been
objected to by the Central Land Council (CLC) as a result of a Native Title Claim. The Tribunal
dealing with the matter has asked the parties, namely the Northern Territory Government and
the CLC to provide certain supporting information. Given no site activities are planned at the
KLPP in the next 12 months, and adequate mixed harvest salts have already been sourced
from prior evaporation trials, at this stage, the Company does not expect delays in the tenure
consolidation process to delay the completion of the KLPP-PFS.

ii)

New Mexico Lithium Project (NMLP, 70% interest, earning 100%)

The NMLP is based on the large central portion of the Lordsburg Playa in the Animas Valley
in southwest New Mexico (Figure 2). Parkway Minerals has earned a 70% interest in the
project by funding tenement renewals and early stage exploration activities and has the right
to move to 100% ownership. The project is located in a region of high heat-flow as evidenced
by regional geothermal activity and is highly prospective for lithium and potash in hypersaline
brines interpreted to be present beneath the playa. During the quarter, the Company continued
to engage potential farminees, however farm-out negotiations have been significantly
impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions. The Company received several expressions of
interest, however, is still assessing options to move the project forward, despite COVID-19
related challenges. In order to provide maximum optionality, the Company has received
proposals from a number of contractors and has secured a range of approvals necessary to
potentially drill-test the project with a single low-cost drill hole (estimated budget less than
A$100,000) to assess the prospectivity of the interpreted shallow brines.

Figure 2: New Mexico Lithium Project (NMLP) Location
iii)

Dandaragan Trough Project (DTP)

As outlined in the March 2020 Quarterly Report, following a detailed project review, the
Company has deemed the DTP to be non-core and has recently divested its interest in the
project.

CORPORATE
Investments
Strategic Investment – Davenport Resources (ASX: DAV)
Parkway Minerals owns 34,267,700 shares in Davenport Resources (ASX: DAV),
representing approximately 19.86% of the issued capital of Davenport Resources (as of the
date of this report). Davenport Resources is an ASX listed junior mining company which has

| 6

For personal use only

one of the largest undeveloped potash resource inventories in Western Europe. Davenport
Resources is focused on the appraisal and potential development of the South Harz potash
field in Thuringia, Central Germany. Given the globally significant scale of the potash resource
delineated by Davenport Resources in an existing potash producing region, Parkway Minerals
believes there is an opportunity for Davenport Resources to create and unlock substantial
value.
Strategic Opportunities
Challenging business conditions as a result of COVID-19 related disruptions, have created a
range of potentially attractive corporate opportunities. The Company has identified several
relatively small, but potentially strategic acquisition opportunities, which may provide Parkway
Minerals with a pathway to near-term revenue generation, whilst concurrently assisting in
accelerating the commercialisation of its technology portfolio. It should be noted that these
discussions are at a relatively early stage, and there can be no certainty on the type of
transaction, if any, which may arise as a result of ongoing or any future discussions.

Funding
The Company remains well funded with a cash balance of $2 million at 30 June 2020. In
addition to the cash balance at quarter end, the Company holds an additional ~$1.5 million in
marketable securities (shares in Davenport Resources), and a range of other non-dilutive
funding sources outlined below, which ensures Parkway Minerals is funded well into CY2021.
Cost Reductions
During the quarter, the Company continued to implement a number of cost-saving measures
including a reduction in corporate overheads and participation by the board and CFO in the
Parkway Minerals Salary Sacrifice Share Plan (SSSP), which involves electing to accept 30%
of remuneration by way of issuance of Parkway Minerals shares based on the VWAP during
the relevant period.
Grant Funds
The Company has historically had a strong track-record in securing a range of grants to
subsidise the costs of performing innovative research and development (R&D) and associated
commercialisation activities. To date, the company has been successful in every innovation
and technology related grant application it has applied for, including a number of highly
competitive and prestigious Australian Research Council (ARC) grants.
The majority of KLPP-PFS related tasks being performed at Victoria University, including the
installation, commissioning and testing of a state-of-the-art aMES™ pilot plant is being funded
by a previously awarded ARC supported grant (remaining gross balance of ~$420,000).
Following the acquisition of the iBC™ technology in May 2020, in June 2020, Parkway
Minerals secured $55,000 in Commonwealth funding by way of an Innovation Connections
Grant. Parkway Minerals acknowledges the financial support of the Australian Government.
R&D Rebate
Given the historical and ongoing R&D activities being performed and/or funded by the
Company, the Company anticipates receiving an Australian Government research and
development tax incentive (R&DTI) payment by way of a refundable tax offset of
approximately $56,000 for FY20. Due to increased levels of R&D activity in FY21, including

June 2020 Quarterly Report
