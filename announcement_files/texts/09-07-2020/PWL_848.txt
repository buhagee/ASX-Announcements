Joint Announcement

Recommended off-market takeover offer by
Praemium for Powerwrap
Transaction Overview
Praemium Limited (Praemium) (ASX:PPS) and Powerwrap Limited (Powerwrap)
(ASX:PWL) are pleased to announce that they have entered into a bid implementation
agreement dated 9 July 2020 (BIA), under which it is proposed that Praemium will make an
off-market conditional takeover bid for all of the issued fully paid ordinary shares of
Powerwrap (Powerwrap Shares) which it does not presently hold (Offer). A copy of the
BIA is attached at Annexure A.
Highlights


The Offer values Powerwrap at an indicative price of 26.44 cents per Powerwrap Share
(Indicative Price), or $55.6 million for all of Powerwrap’s issued share capital.1



Under the Offer, each holder of Powerwrap Shares (Powerwrap Shareholder) will
receive:
o

7.5 cents per Powerwrap Share in cash; and

o

1 Praemium Share for every 2 Powerwrap Shares held2,

(together, the Offer Consideration).


The Powerwrap board of directors (Powerwrap Board) unanimously recommend
that Powerwrap Shareholders ACCEPT THE OFFER and have indicated that they will
ACCEPT THE OFFER in respect of all Powerwrap Shares they own or control, in both
instances, in the absence of a superior proposal.

Based on Powerwrap’s fully diluted share count at the date of the Offer of 210,083,199 (not including Performance Rights
which may vest following the finalisation of the Audited Financial Accounts for the year to 30 June 2020. Total diluted shares
post issue of these Performance Rights will be no greater than 212.0 million shares), and a deemed price per Praemium Share
of 26.44 cents, based on a 5-day VWAP ending on 8 July 2020.
2
Foreign shareholders (being Powerwrap Shareholders with a registered address outside of Australia and its external
territories) who accept the Offer will not be entitled to receive Praemium Shares. Instead, the Praemium Shares that foreign
shareholders would have been entitled to receive will be issued to, and sold by, a nominee and the net proceeds will be paid to
each relevant foreign shareholder pro-rata according to their respective holdings of Powerwrap Shares.
1



There are a number of other very compelling reasons for Powerwrap Shareholders to
ACCEPT THE OFFER:

For personal use only

o

the Indicative Price represents a very attractive premium of:


51.1% to the last closing price of Powerwrap Shares prior to the date of this
announcement;

o



82.3% to the 3-month VWAP of Powerwrap Shares of $0.145; and



138.4% to the 6-month VWAP of Powerwrap Shares of $0.111;

Powerwrap Shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in the benefits
of a merged group which will be one of Australia’s largest independent specialist
platform providers on a combined funds under administration (FUA) basis
(Merged Group);

o

anticipated reduction in the operational, financial and competition risks
associated with continuing to hold Powerwrap Shares on a standalone basis,
while gaining exposure to Praemium’s proven track record of profit and growth;

o

Powerwrap Shareholders will be able to participate in the expected upside from
the realisation of potentially significant synergies, with full year EBITDA
operating cost synergies expected (on a preliminary basis) to total $6.0 million
by FY2022;

o

the likelihood of a competing proposal emerging is low given Praemium’s existing
15.1% interest in Powerwrap3;

o

there are possible risks of remaining as a minority shareholder of Powerwrap;

o

potential access to CGT scrip-for-scrip rollover relief; and

o

Australian Powerwrap Shareholders will not pay stamp duty and are unlikely to
incur brokerage costs in accepting the Offer and transferring Powerwrap Shares.

3

Determined on an undiluted basis. At the date of this announcement, Praemium owns 31,082,272 Powerwrap Shares.

Commenting on the proposed transaction, Barry Lewin, Chairman of Praemium said:

For personal use only

“The merger is an exciting opportunity for Powerwrap and Praemium shareholders

alike. For many years, Praemium has been on a growth trajectory with a recent
history of generating steadily growing profitability. This merger adds increased scale
and significant synergies. Powerwrap shareholders can now gain exposure to
Praemium’s strong financial position and advanced technology, to realise compelling
benefits via the creation of one of Australia’s leading independent specialist platform
providers on a combined FUA basis.”
Anthony Wamsteker, Chairman of Powerwrap said:
“The board of Powerwrap believes the Offer presents an excellent opportunity for

Powerwrap shareholders to participate in the upside of a merged group that stands
to benefit from significant potential synergies. With Powerwrap’s strong customer
base and Praemium’s track record of profitability and cutting-edge technology, the
benefits to Powerwrap shareholders are clear to the board and we encourage
Powerwrap shareholders to take the next step in the company’s journey.”
The Offer
The Offer represents a highly strategic opportunity to bring together Praemium and
Powerwrap to create a leading financial platform business with combined FUA of over $27
billion, with operations in Australia, Asia and the United Kingdom. It also provides
Powerwrap Shareholders with an opportunity to crystallise meaningful value from their
investment in Powerwrap in the foreseeable future.
Unanimous Recommendation by Powerwrap Board
The Powerwrap Board have carefully considered the Offer and unanimously recommend that
Powerwrap Shareholders ACCEPT THE OFFER and have indicated that they will ACCEPT
THE OFFER in respect of all Powerwrap Shares they own or control, in both instances, in
the absence of a superior proposal.
Bid Implementation Agreement
Praemium and Powerwrap have agreed the BIA (attached as Annexure A) pursuant to which
the parties have given undertakings to each other in order to facilitate the Offer.
The Offer is subject to a number of conditions, including:


90% minimum acceptance by Powerwrap Shareholders;

For personal use only



No prescribed occurrences in relation to Powerwrap;



No material adverse changes in relation to Powerwrap;



No adverse regulatory event affecting the Offer; and



The All Ordinaries Index does not, for a period of 3 consecutive trading days, fall
below 30% of the level of that index as at the close of normal trading on the ASX on
the date of this announcement.

The full list of conditions is set out in the BIA. The BIA also contains a customary “no shop”
deal protection mechanism, as well as notification and matching rights in the event of a
competing proposal.
Competing Proposal
Praemium is Powerwrap’s largest shareholder with an existing relevant interest of 15.1% of
the Powerwrap Shares on issue. As a consequence, Praemium believes that the likelihood of
a competing proposal emerging for Powerwrap Shares is low.
Funding
Praemium intends to fund the cash component of the Offer Consideration through a $15
million term loan facility, which it recently entered into.
Indicative Timing and Next Steps
Powerwrap Shareholders do not need to take any action in relation to the Offer at this
stage. Praemium intends to lodge a copy of its Bidder’s Statement with ASIC and send a
copy to Powerwrap and ASX on 16 July 2020 (although that is subject to change). The
Bidder’s Statement will contain detailed information relevant to the Offer, including how to
accept.
Advisers
Deloitte is acting as financial advisor and Nicholson Ryan and Arnold Bloch Leibler are acting
as legal advisors to Praemium in relation to the Offer.
Henslow is acting as financial advisor and Hall and Wilcox is acting as legal advisor to
Powerwrap in relation to the Offer.

Dear Mr Wamsteker
Implementation of Takeover Bid
1

Background

1.1

Praemium Limited ACN 098 405 826 (Praemium) has submitted a confidential, non-binding,
indicative proposal (NBIO) to acquire 100% of the fully paid ordinary shares in Powerwrap Limited
ACN 129 756 850 (Powerwrap), by way of an off-market takeover bid (Takeover Bid). Following
subsequent confidential discussions between the parties, Praemium wishes to set out the terms on
which Praemium and Powerwrap will seek to implement the Takeover Bid.

1.2

On you returning to us a countersigned copy of this letter, the terms of this letter will operate as a
binding agreement (Agreement) between each of Praemium and Powerwrap (each a party)
effective from the date of return to us.

2

Takeover Bid

2.1

Praemium agrees to make offers pursuant to the Takeover Bid in accordance with Chapter 6 of the
Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) to acquire all of the fully paid ordinary shares in Powerwrap
that it does not already hold (Powerwrap Shares).

2.2

Immediately after you have returned a countersigned copy of this Agreement, Powerwrap and
Praemium will issue a joint public announcement concerning the Takeover Bid, in the form annexed
to this Agreement or as otherwise agreed between the parties.

2.3

Powerwrap confirms that the Powerwrap board of directors (Powerwrap Board):
(a)

has met and considered the possibility of Praemium making the Takeover Bid; and

(b)

has informed Praemium that, if Praemium complies with this Agreement and subject always
to paragraph 10.1, all of the directors on the Powerwrap board will:
(i)

unanimously recommend Powerwrap shareholders to accept the offers under the
Takeover Bid; and

(ii)

accept, or procure the acceptance of, offers under the Takeover Bid in respect of
any Powerwrap Shares they control,

in each case, in the absence of a superior proposal.
3

Offer Consideration

3.1

Subject to paragraph 3.2, under the offers to be made to Powerwrap shareholders pursuant to the
Takeover Bid (Offers), each Powerwrap shareholder will receive as consideration:
(a)

7.5 cents per Powerwrap Share in cash; and

(b)

1 fully paid ordinary share in Praemium (Praemium Share) for every 2 Powerwrap Shares
owned by that Powerwrap shareholder,

For personal use only

(together, the Offer Consideration).
3.2

Subject to the Act, Praemium will issue Praemium Shares to which a foreign Powerwrap shareholder
would otherwise be entitled to a nominee appointed by Praemium who will sell those Praemium
Shares and pay to that foreign Powerwrap shareholder the net proceeds received (after deducting
the applicable brokerage (applied at market standard rates), taxes and charges) in accordance with
the Offer, calculated on an average basis per Praemium Share, so that all foreign Powerwrap
shareholders receive the same price per Praemium Share (subject to rounding).

4

Bid Conditions

4.1

The Offers are subject to the conditions set out in Schedule 1 (Bid Conditions) and each party
must use reasonable endeavours not to do, or omit to do, anything which will, or is likely to, result
in any Bid Condition being breached.

4.2

Praemium may vary the terms and conditions of the Takeover Bid in any manner which is permitted
by the Act, provided:
(a)

the varied terms and conditions are no less favourable to Powerwrap shareholders than set
out in this Agreement; and

(b)

Praemium consults in good faith with Powerwrap prior to making such variation.

4.3

Subject to the Act, Praemium may declare the Takeover Bid to be free from any Bid Condition or
extend the Takeover Bid at any time.

4.4

For the purposes of Bid Condition 1.8 of Schedule 1, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, Powerwrap undertakes:
(a)

to use all reasonable endeavours secure all third-party consents or approvals required in
connection with change of control rights under material contracts;

(b)

to consult with, and consider all reasonable requests and suggestions received from,
Praemium in relation to securing those consents or approvals, including on Praemium’s
reasonable request, allowing Praemium to attend any meetings or telephone calls with the
counterparties to those material contracts; and

(c)

to provide Praemium copies of all documents provided to and received from those
counterparties following execution of this Agreement, other than those documents of a
purely mechanical or housekeeping nature.

5

Facilitating the Offers

5.1

Each party agrees to provide the other, on a timely basis, with information that may be reasonably
required to assist in the dispatch of the Offers, the preparation of the Bidder’s Statement or Target
Statement (as the case may be) or to satisfy any of the Bid Conditions.

5.2

Subject to Praemium complying with paragraph 5.3 and provided Praemium has first lodged the
Bidder’s Statement with ASIC and provided it to Powerwrap pursuant to items 2 and 3 of section
633(1) of the Act, Powerwrap agrees that the Offers and accompanying documents to be sent by
Praemium under item 6 of section 633(1) of the Act may be sent on a date nominated by Praemium
that is earlier than the date prescribed by item 6 of section 633(1) of the Act.

5.3

Subject to paragraph 5.4, the parties will cooperate with each other in good faith to implement the
Takeover Bid as expeditiously as practicable, including by giving the other party a reasonable

For personal use only

opportunity to review an advanced draft of the Bidder’s Statement or Target’s Statement (as
applicable) and consult in good faith with the other party with respect to any comments they may
have.
5.4

Powerwrap agrees to include in all material public statements relating primarily to the Takeover
Bid (following the initial announcement of the Takeover Bid made pursuant to paragraph 2.2) and
in the Target’s Statement, a statement to the effect that:
(a)

the Powerwrap Board unanimously recommend that Powerwrap shareholders accept the
Offers; and

(b)

each Powerwrap director intends to accept, or procure the acceptance of, the Offers made
to them in respect of all Powerwrap Shares they control,

5.5

During the period in which the Offers are open for acceptance (Offer Period), in the absence of
a superior proposal and subject always to paragraph 10.1, the Powerwrap Board must use
reasonable endeavours to participate in efforts reasonably required by Praemium to promote the
merits of the Takeover Bid. The Offer Period will initially last for at least one month and shall be
subject to Praemium’s right to extend the Offer Period.

5.6

Powerwrap further agrees during the Offer Period not to make any public statement or take any
other action which would suggest that the Takeover Bid is not unanimously recommended by the
Powerwrap Board unless a superior proposal emerges, and not to withdraw its recommendation
subsequently unless a superior proposal emerges subject always to paragraph 10.1.

5.7

The parties agree that an independent expert report in connection with the Takeover Bid is not
required by section 640 of the Act.

5.8

Praemium must not apply to ASIC for consent to withdraw unaccepted Offers under section 652B
of the Corporations Act without Powerwrap’s prior written consent.

6

Conduct during the exclusivity period

6.1

From the date of this Agreement until the end of the exclusivity period contemplated by paragraph
7, each party must, and must procure that each of their subsidiaries:

conducts their business in the usual and ordinary course and on a basis consistent with the
manner in which it was conducted immediately prior to the date of this Agreement;

(b)

take reasonable steps to preserve and maintain the value of their business and assets, and
their relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others with whom they have
material business dealings;

(c)

not issue any shares or other securities, except as a consequence of:

(d)

(i)

the exercise of performance rights on issue at the date of this Agreement in
accordance with their current terms; or

(ii)

in the case of Praemium only, the exercise of options on issue at the date of this
Agreement, under a dividend reinvestment plan or to employees under long-term
incentive plans consistent with past practice;

not, without the prior written consent of the other party, announce, pay or declare any
dividend; and

For personal use only

(e)

in the case of Powerwrap only, not vary, amend or modify any material contract without
the prior written consent of Praemium.

6.2

The obligations in paragraph 6.1 do not apply in respect of (1) any matter required to be done or
contemplated by this Agreement or the Takeover Bid, (2) required to be done by law, by an order
of a court or a government agency, (3) approved in writing by the other party (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or (4) any matter fully and frankly disclosed by the other
party to the ASX before the date of this Agreement (other than in connection with the issue of any
shares or other securities).

7

Exclusivity

7.1

During the period from and including the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the date of
termination of this Agreement or the end of the Offer Period (Exclusivity Period), Powerwrap
must not, and must ensure that its subsidiaries do not and must use best endeavours to ensure
that each of its Related Persons do not, directly or indirectly solicit, invite, encourage or initiate, or
continue (including by the provision of non-public information) any inquiry, expression of interest,
offer, proposal or discussion by any person in relation to, or which would reasonably be expected
to encourage or lead to the making of, an actual, proposed or potential competing proposal to the
Takeover Bid (Competing Proposal) or communicate to any person an intention to do anything
referred to in this paragraph.

7.2

For clarity, nothing in this paragraph 7 will prohibit any action or inaction by Powerwrap or any of
its Related Persons in relation to an actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal if compliance
with any part of this paragraph 7 would, in the opinion of the Powerwrap Board, formed in good
faith, constitute, or would be likely to constitute, a breach of any of the fiduciary or statutory duties
of the Directors, provided that the actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal was not
directly or indirectly brought about by, or facilitated by, a breach of paragraph 7.1.

7.3

During the Exclusivity Period, Powerwrap must as soon as possible notify Praemium in writing if it,
or any of its Related Persons, becomes aware of any:
(a)

negotiations, discussions or approaches in relation to an actual, proposed or potential
Competing Proposal;

(b)

proposal made to Powerwrap or any of its Related Persons, in connection with, or in respect
of any exploration or completion of, an actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal;
or

(c)

provision by Powerwrap or any of its Related Persons of any non-public information
concerning the business or operations of Powerwrap or any of its subsidiaries to a third
party (other than a government agency) in connection with an actual, proposed or potential
Competing Proposal,

whether direct or indirect, solicited or unsolicited, and in writing or otherwise. For the avoidance of
doubt, any of the acts described in paragraphs (a), to (c) may only be taken by Powerwrap if not
prescribed by paragraph 7.1 or if permitted by paragraph 7.2.
7.4

Without limiting paragraph 7.1, during the Exclusivity Period, Powerwrap must not (and must
procure that its directors do not) enter into any legally binding agreement in connection with, give
effect to, or seek to give effect to, a Competing Proposal unless:
(a)

the Powerwrap Board acting in good faith and in order to satisfy what the members of the
Powerwrap Board consider to be their statutory or fiduciary duties determines that the

For personal use only

Competing Proposal would be or would be likely to be an actual, proposed or potential
superior proposal;
(b)

Powerwrap has provided Praemium with the material terms and conditions of the actual,
proposed or potential Competing Proposal, including price and the identity of the third
party making the actual, proposed or potential Competing Proposal;

(c)

Powerwrap has given Praemium at least 3 business days after the date of the provision of
the information referred to in paragraph 7.4(b) to provide a matching or superior proposal

10

Overriding Fiduciary and Statutory Duties of Powerwrap Board

10.1

Nothing in this Agreement, without limitation and despite anything else set out in this Agreement:
(a)

prevents Powerwrap or any of its directors, officers, employees or advisors (Related
Persons) from taking, or failing to take, any action (including, for the avoidance of any
doubt, changing their recommendation in relation to the Takeover Bid); or

(b)

requires Powerwrap or any Related Person to take any action or do any thing,

where to do so would or would be likely to, in the opinion of the Powerwrap Board (in the case of
Powerwrap) or otherwise of the relevant Related Person (in either case, to be determined in good
faith and acting reasonably), constitute a breach of any directors’ fiduciary or statutory duties.
11

Miscellaneous

11.1

Each party to the Agreement:
(a)

will bear its own costs of the Takeover Bid and the transactions contemplated by it, except
any stamp duty which is payable by Praemium; and

(b)

agrees that if any part of the Agreement is invalid or unenforceable it will be excluded to
the minimum extent required without affecting the balance of the Agreement.

11.2

This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties on the subject matter.

11.3

The Agreement may consist of a number of counterparts and, if so, the counterparts taken together
constitute one agreement.

consent in its absolute discretion, unless this Agreement expressly provides otherwise.
