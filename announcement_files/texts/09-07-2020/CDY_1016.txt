RE: ASX Aware query
We refer to your letter of 6 July 2020 to Cellmid Limited (“CDY” or the “Company”)
and adopting similar paragraph numbering as contained therein we respond as
follows:
1. The Company does not consider the Information to be information that a
reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value
of its securities.
2. The basis for the view in the response to question 1 is that, in the Company’s
opinion, there was no material change to the existing agreement between the
Company and Australia Application Pty Ltd (“Australia Application”). As advised
in the ASX announcement dated 27 March 2020 (“Cellmid Signs COVID-19 Rapid
Diagnostic Supply Agreement”) the original agreement was signed for a term of
one year and therefore originally ran until March 2021.
This agreement was amended on 29 April 2020 to remove a minimum order
requirement by 30 April 2020 and at this time the agreement term was also
amended to run for a period of 6 months.
The latest amendment to the agreement with Australia Application was to bring
the agreement in line with Australia Application’s separate agreement with
Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co. Ltd (“Wondfo”) which was originally due to
expire on 30 June 2020 (as disclosed in the ASX announcements dated 21 May
2020 and 4 June 2020) and had itself been extended until 30 December 2020.
Whilst the Company’s agreement with Australia Application has effectively been
shortened from the original agreement it may be extended beyond 30
December 2020 with written consent and therefore, in the Company’s opinion,
does not represent a material change to the original agreement.
Further, whilst amending the agreement the Company took the opportunity to
remove a term requiring a minimum number of tests to have been ordered by
the Company by 31 July 2020. As the deadline for this minimum order had not
arrived and the amendment does not impact the Company’s ongoing access to
the test the Company is of the opinion that this did not represent a material
change to the original agreement.

Dear Mr Tamplin
Cellmid Limited (‘CDY’): Aware Query
ASX refers to the following:
A.

CDY’s announcement titled ‘Extension Of Wondfo Rapid Test Distribution Agreement’ released on the ASX
Market Announcements Platform on 2 July 2020 (‘Announcement’), which included the following
statements (the ‘Information’):
‘Cellmid and Australia Application have also amended their agreement (Agreement) for Cellmid to
be a distributor of the Wondfo test in Australia such that the Agreement now also runs until
30 December 2020 and previous minimum order requirements have been removed … Both the
agreements between Wondfo and Australia Application and Australia Application and Cellmid may
be extended beyond 30 December 2020 with written consent.’

B.

The change in the price of CDY’s securities from $0.10 on 1 July 2020 (closing price) to $0.12 on 2 July 2020
(closing price) followed by a high of $0.13 on 3 July 2020.

C.

Listing Rule 3.1, which requires a listed entity to immediately give ASX any information concerning it that
a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity’s securities.

D.

The definition of ‘aware’ in Chapter 19 of the Listing Rules, which states that:
‘an entity becomes aware of information if, and as soon as, an officer of the entity (or, in the case
of a trust, an officer of the responsible entity) has, or ought reasonably to have, come into
possession of the information in the course of the performance of their duties as an officer of that
entity” and section 4.4 in Guidance Note 8 Continuous Disclosure: Listing Rules 3.1 – 3.1B “When
does an entity become aware of information”.’

E.

Listing Rule 3.1A, which sets out exceptions from the requirement to make immediate disclosure,
provided that each of the following are satisfied.
‘3.1A

Listing rule 3.1 does not apply to particular information while each of the following is
satisfied in relation to the information:

3.1A.1 One or more of the following applies:
• It would be a breach of a law to disclose the information;
• The information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation;
• The information comprises matters of supposition or is insufficiently definite to warrant
disclosure;

Questions and Request for Information
Having regard to the above, ASX asks CDY to respond separately to each of the following questions and requests

If the answer to question 1 is ‘no’, please advise the basis for that view.

3.

When did CDY first become aware of the Information?

4.

If the answer to question 1 is ‘yes’ and CDY first became aware of the Information before the relevant date,
please explain why the Information was not released to the market at an earlier time, commenting
specifically on when you believe CDY was obliged to release the Information under Listing Rules 3.1 and
3.1A and what steps CDY took to ensure that the Information was released promptly and without delay.

5.

Please confirm that CDY is complying with the Listing Rules and, in particular, Listing Rule 3.1.
