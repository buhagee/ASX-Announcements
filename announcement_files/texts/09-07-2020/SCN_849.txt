_____________________________________________________

Scorpion Minerals Limited (the Company; ASX: SCN) is pleased to provide results
from recent rock chip sampling undertaken recently at its Pharos Project located
approximately 50kms north west of Cue in the Murchison district. The Company
has an Option to Acquire 100% of two exploration tenements, E20/948 and
E20/953 from Element 25 (ASX: E25)1 (refer Figures, 1, 2)
During heritage clearance surveys in June, the Company undertook additional
rock chip sampling of areas outside the known Beacon, Lantern and Candle
prospect areas within the newly granted2 E20/948 tenement. Selective rock chip
sampling of outcrop and workings, including quartz veins of various orientations
in high priority zones was undertaken. Fifty-seven samples were taken for
analysis by fire assay, with seventeen samples returning anomalous values above
150 ppb. (refer Table 1 for a complete list of results).
Highlights from rock chip samples include two high grade (10.5 g/t Au and 10.0
g/t Au) assays returned from undrilled workings 200m apart, at a prospect now
named Salt Flat, 200m West of Cap Lamp (refer figure 5 and photo 2).
A line of workings at Cap Lamp returned multiple high grade values from channel
sampling of veining in the only easily accessible area, with a maximum value of
7.5 g/t Au, and an approximate average value of 2.1 g/t Au over approximately
5m length (refer figure 5 and photo 1).
At Cap Lamp, the company has compiled additional historical drilling results
which include RAB drilling highlights of 2m @ 5.5 g/t Au from 18m and various
anomalous results (refer Table 2 for a complete list of results).

The historical RAB drilling in the vicinity of these workings was not overlapping and is considered to have
not adequately tested this area (refer Figure 5).

For personal use only

Additional anomalous results were returned from stoped quartz veins at Oliver’s (maximum assay 3.0
g/t Au, and from a working on P20/22533, where material returned a maximum value of 1.2 g/t Au.
The Company has now completed a heritage clearance survey at Atlanta, west of Beacon, where
historical reconnaissance drilling returned a value of 5m @ 0.7 g/t Au (mineralised laterite). Historically
this has not been followed up and will now be one of the targets tested in the planned RC drilling
programme.
The Company considers that the Beacon, Candle, Lantern and newly outlined prospects such as Cap
Lamp and ‘Salt Flat’ areas contain multiple quartz vein targets similar to “Day Dawn” style mineralisation
(refer Figure 1), and is highly encouraged by the open-ended nature of the current prospects.
Planning for an RC drilling programme is underway and will initially focus on several lines at a 40m x 40m
grid spacing to around 100m depth targeted at the high grade mineralisation at the Lantern prospect. In
addition, RC drilling will be completed to test zones at Candle, Beacon, Cap Lamp, Salt Flat, Oliver’s and
Atlanta.
The programmes at Lantern, Candle, Beacon and Atlanta will commence once Heritage clearance is
received. A Programme of Works (PoW) application for the Cap lamp and Salt Flat Area is currently being
prepared and drilling will commence once approval is granted. PoW approval has been received for
Lantern, Candle, Beacon and Atlanta.
General Discussion of Mineral Potential of Pharos Project
Granted E20/948 and applications E20/953 and E 20/962 - together the Pharos Project- cover 640 km2,
and are contiguous with 58 km2 of granted SCN tenure (E20/931), which contains the Mount Mulcahy
copper-zinc volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VMS) deposit, a zone of mineralisation with a JORC 2012
Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resource of 647,000 tonnes @ 2.4% copper, 1.8% zinc, 0.1% cobalt
and 20g/t Ag (refer PUN:ASX release 25 September 2014 and Table 1, also Figures 1, 2 & 3) at the ‘South
Limb Pod’ (SLP).
The Pharos Project tenements are considered prospective for a number of gold mineralisation types
including:

3

1. Shear zone hosted lode style mineralisation hosted in mafic, ultramafic and felsic volcanics
2. Banded Iron hosted “Hill 50” style replacement deposits
3. High grade quartz vein “Day Dawn” style mineralisation hosted within dolerite and basalt
4. Felsic porphyry hosted quartz stockwork and ladder vein mineralisation

Refer ASX:SCN release dated 12th March 2020 “Tenement acquisitions build Pharos Project”

For personal use only

The Company has noted several significant historical gold intercepts from Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drilling
undertaken by previous companies on the tenements, including the following high grade intersections
from the Lantern prospect on E20/948, following up on an original 3100 ppb soil sample in the 1990’s
from Guardian Resources:
•
•

12 m @ 7.40 g/t Au from 44 m, including 2 m @ 42.4 g/t Au in Hole
16 m@ 3.09 g/t Au from 0 m, including 2 m @ 16.8 g/t Au

Planned systematic exploration will focus on interpreted structural controls for primarily gold
mineralisation associated with NNW trending splay structures off the Big Bell Shear (refer Figure 2), a
major regional structure associated with significant gold endowment, including the 5Moz Big Bell gold
deposit (refer Figure 1). The Company believes that significant potential for new gold and base metal
deposits exist within the expanded project area.
The stratigraphic sequence to the west of and adjacent to the Big Bell shear contains all the above rock
types and systematic exploration has not been undertaken historically where the NW-NNW trending
splays off the Big Bell shear intersect these lithologies (refer Figure 2). Previous explorers have noted
repeated observation of sericite-chlorite-carbonate alteration and pyrite-arsenopyrite mineralisation
associated with gold mineralisation, which the company believes indicative of large Archean gold
hydrothermal systems.
Planned future exploration includes:
1. Reprocessing of existing air magnetics and completion of a regional geologic interpretation
2. Detailed geological mapping of selected target areas.
3. Systematic auger soils geochemical sampling of the project initially focusing on high priority

targets.
4. Follow up RC drilling of historic drill intercepts at Candle, Lantern, Mustang Sally, Ulysses and
Laterite Hill.
The Company plans a separate release discussing the geology and mineral potential of the Ulysses
prospect on E20/953 after additional compilation and interpretation.
This announcement has been authorised by the board of directors of the Company.

Sampling
techniques

Commentary

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or
specific specialised industry standard measurement tools
appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These
examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material
to the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would
be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to
obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a
30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may
be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types
(eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.

parties

• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.

• Initially North Flinders Mines, then primarily Guardian Resources NL, and
Equinox Resources between 1991 and 1995, and after that later Hampton Hill
Mining NL undertook geological mapping, airborne and ground magnetic
surveys, soil sampling, rock chip and RAB, Vacuum and Aircore drilling. MIM
entered the area searching for VHMS base metals and shear related gold,
successfully outlining a coherent 3km long >20ppb Au in saprolite anomaly at
Ulysses East with RAB, Aircore and RC drilling, but withdrew in 1997. Newcrest
Operations Limited then entered the area, completing additional RAB drilling
and a 438.5 m diamond core hole at Ulysses East, and extending that anomaly
to 4.5km in length, and drilling additional anomalism north of Oliver ‘s Patch,
at the Candle prospect. Alchemy Resources drilled a single Aircore line of 7
holes at 200m spacing across the Olivers Patch anomalism, at a target the
named Wydgee 7. The central hole (WGAC004) proximal to workings and
alteration was weakly anomalous for gold (12m @ 12ppb from 40m)

• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the
exploration results including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract
from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person
should clearly explain why this is the case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be
stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some
typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.

• Refer to tables in this report.
• NA

• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.

• Intercept lengths are downhole lengths

26

• Assays have been length weighted for calculation of intercepts, no top cut has
been applied, lower cut is 0.2 g/t Au

• The Company has listed internal intervals >2m>10g/t for emphasis

mineralisation
widths and
intercept
lengths

• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported,
there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole
length, true width not known’).

• Not known

Diagrams

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting
of Exploration Results.
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test
results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.

• Refer to maps included in this report

• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions,
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling
areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.
