For personal use only

Chalice Gold Mines Limited (“Chalice” or “the Company”, ASX: CHN | OTCQB: CGMLF) is pleased to report
significant new results from ongoing exploration activities at its 100%-owned Julimar Nickel-Copper-PGE
Project, located ~70km north-east of Perth in Western Australia.

Three rigs (two Reverse Circulation (“RC”) and one diamond) are currently drilling at the Gonneville
Intrusion – where Chalice recently made a high-grade PGE-Ni-Cu-Co discovery in March 2020 (refer to ASX
Announcement on 23 March 2020).

Drilling results continue to demonstrate that the Intrusion hosts both extensive high-grade PGE-Ni-Cu-Co
zones in massive/matrix/stringer sulphides and widespread PGE mineralisation in disseminated sulphides.
The latest results highlight the potential for continued growth of the high-grade massive/matrix/stringer
sulphide mineralisation.

The Company continues its dual approach of targeting both extensions of known high-grade PGE-Ni-CuCo zones (G1-G3) with 40-80m spaced step-out drill holes and scoping out the extensive zones of PGE-rich
disseminated sulphides on a 200m x 80m spaced grid. A total of 10 diamond drill holes and 36 RC drill holes
have been completed to date.
Assays have been received for two new diamond holes (JD004 and 5) and a further five RC holes (JRC01317). Assays are pending for a further 24 completed drill holes (5 diamond and 19 RC).

In addition, a deep penetrating Fixed Loop HT SQUID EM (FLEM) survey and infill Moving Loop EM (MLEM)
survey were recently completed over the entire ~1.6km x ~0.7km Intrusion. Several new deep EM targets
were identified as well as potential extensions of existing high-grade mineralised zones.

Drilling results – G1-G2 Zones – JD005
JD005 was drilled ~40m north of the discovery hole JRC001 (33m @ 6.5g/t Pd, 0.7g/t Pt, 1.6% Ni, 0.7% Cu,
0.1% Co from 44m) to test along strike of the projected trend of the G1-G2 zone (Figure 1).

For personal use only

JD005 intersected multiple shallow PGE-rich zones, including at the projected G1-G2 target depths, with
these occurring within a broad halo of trace to 3% disseminated sulphides. The mineralisation comprises
mostly disseminated sulphides (up to 5-10% sulphides) in serpentinite with narrow zones of matrix sulphides.
JD005 also intersected a wide interval of a new style of high-grade PGE-copper-gold mineralisation at
depth which comprises disseminated chalcopyrite-rich sulphides in serpentinite (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Gonneville Cross Section JD005 and JRC005, 26 (6,512,360mN +/- 25m).

JD005 ended in mineralisation and, as such, this newly-discovered zone is wide-open in all directions.
Downhole EM completed on JD005 has identified an extensive, ~800 Siemens EM Conductor
corresponding with the new zone.

Nearby drill holes are interpreted to have been too shallow to test this horizon elsewhere within the
Gonneville Intrusion. Accordingly, a diamond tail is currently being drilled on JRC005, ~80m east up-dip of
the intercept.

Drilling results – G1-G2 Zones – JD010

For personal use only

JD010 was drilled ~40m south of the discovery hole on an oblique azimuth (due to access constraints
related to remnant vegetation), to test the southern extension of the G1 zone and to test a 7,000 Siemens
EM conductor identified from the recent infill MLEM survey.
JD010 intersected a ~15m wide zone of mostly matrix sulphides with narrow massive sulphides from ~81m
down-hole at the projected intersection of the modelled EM conductor. This has resulted in a modified
interpretation of the G1 and G2 zones, with the discovery zone (G1) now interpreted to continue both to
the north-north-east and south over a strike length of ~400m.

The high-grade interval intersected in JRC006 (41m @ 2.6g/t Pd, 0.4g/t Pt, 0.5% Ni, 0.4% Cu, 0.03% Co from
39m) is now interpreted to be a separate zone (G2) and remains open along strike. More drilling is required
in this area to confirm.

Importantly, JD010 has confirmed that the G1 zone is open to the south. Recent auger soil geochemical
sampling over the entire Gonneville Intrusion has identified highly anomalous PGE-Ni-Cu-Au in soils over a
~650m x 250m area at the southern end of the Intrusion. A peak Pd-in-soil value of 14.1g/t Pd was obtained
immediately south of the discovery hole JRC001.

A large MLEM conductor (Conductor ‘F’) was previously identified in the area and as such, the area has
been confirmed as a high-priority target. Permit approval for drilling was recently obtained and RC drilling
in that area has commenced.
Drilling results – Disseminated Sulphide Zones

JD004 was drilled at the northern end of the Gonneville Intrusion, immediately adjacent and parallel to
JRC010 (~5m collar separation), to provide core samples for metallurgical testwork and to provide a
comparison of assay results for RC vs diamond core.

JD004 intersected a wide zone of serpentinite-hosted disseminated sulphides, comparable in width and
grade to that reported for JRC010, confirming negligible grade variances between the drilling and
sampling techniques.

An east-west traverse of 11 RC drill holes has been completed through the central and widest interpreted
part of the Gonneville Intrusion. Assays have been received for 5 of the 11 holes, and all have intersected
broad intervals of PGE-rich disseminated sulphides (Figure 3).

SQUID EM survey results
A new extensive late-time anomaly was detected in the FLEM survey at the interpreted north-western
margin of the Gonneville Intrusion, co-incident with the margin of the gravity inversion model and
extending beyond the margin of the magnetic inversion model.
The anomaly is modelled as two large conductive zones at a depth of ~600m below surface (Conductors
‘X’ and ‘Y’) and located ~250m north of the high-grade G1-G2 zones (Figure 4).

The overall northerly trend of the conductors along the interpreted plunge projection of the G1 high-grade
zone is viewed as encouraging and approvals are currently being progressed in order to commence a
deep diamond hole to initially test Conductor X.
Chalice has identified widespread sulphide mineralisation within the Intrusion to date, but this new EM data
is interpreted to suggest that mineralisation may extend beyond the Intrusion into the surrounding host
rocks.

High-grade sulphide mineralisation is commonly associated with the margins of mineralised intrusive bodies
in orthomagmatic sulphide systems globally, and there are also numerous examples where sulphide
mineralisation has been remobilised laterally into the surrounding country rocks, resulting in off-contact
zone orientations.
The FLEM and MLEM surveys were also successful in validating the previously identified EM targets within
the Gonneville Intrusion and have re-affirmed the prospectivity of the southern end of the Intrusion where
RC drilling has recently commenced.

Forward plan

For personal use only

Chalice is continuing its approach of simultaneously exploring and evaluating the zones of high grade PGENi-Cu-Co-Au mineralisation and the extensive disseminated PGE-Ni-Cu zones within the large-scale
Gonneville Intrusion.
Ongoing and planned activities at Julimar include:
•

RC drilling – a ~20,000m Phase 2 RC drill program is underway utilising two rigs. Drilling is being
undertaken on a 200m x 80m spaced grid over the ~1.6km x ~0.7km Gonneville Intrusion to provide
sectional east-west coverage and to define the extent of the mineralised system. RC drilling has
recently commenced at the southern end of the Intrusion which is considered a high-priority target
area, as noted above.

•

Diamond drilling – a diamond drill rig will continue to step-out from known high-grade zones (on a
nominal 80m x 80m grid) and test new DHEM targets. The current hole, JRC005D, is being drilled
~80m east of JD005, targeting the up-dip extension of the new PGE-Cu-Au zone.

•

EM Geophysics (DHEM and ground EM) – DHEM continues to play a key role in identifying potential
high-grade targets for follow-up drilling and will be completed on all diamond holes and selected
RC holes. It is important to note the lack of an EM target does not preclude the presence of highgrade mineralisation as evidenced by recent intercepts.

•

Metallurgical testwork – a preliminary metallurgical testwork program is underway on four ore types
– massive, matrix, disseminated and oxide.

•

Access approvals – the approval process to conduct non-ground disturbing exploration activities
within the Julimar State Forest is underway.

About the Julimar Nickel-Copper-PGE Project, Western Australia

For personal use only

The 100%-owned Julimar Nickel-Copper-PGE Project is located ~70km north-east of Perth in Western
Australia on private land and State Forest. The Project was staked in early 2018 as part of Chalice’s global
search for high-potential nickel sulphide exploration opportunities.

Chalice interpreted the possible presence of a mafic-ultramafic layered intrusive complex at Julimar based
on high resolution regional magnetics. The large complex is interpreted to be ~26km long and is confirmed
to be highly prospective for nickel, copper and platinum group elements. Prior to Chalice, it had never
been explored for these metals (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Julimar Project tenure over regional magnetics.

Chalice commenced a systematic, greenfield exploration program in mid-2019 in the southern portion of
the Project, on private land, targeting high-grade Ni-Cu-PGEs.

An initial RC drill program commenced in Q1 2020 and resulted in the discovery of high-grade nickelcopper-cobalt-PGE mineralisation at the newly named Gonneville Intrusion. Drilling to date has established
the ~1.6km x 0.7km Intrusion has widespread zones of PGE mineralisation as well as several wide zones of
high-grade PGE-Ni-Cu-Co-Au. The significant discovery established a new Ni-Cu-PGE province.

For personal use only

High-grade massive / matrix sulphide zones intersected to date are up to ~30m wide and have been
defined over a ~400m x ~280m area. The zones have a grade range of 3-12g/t PGEs, 0.5-3.3% Ni, 0.4-1.2%
Cu and 0.03-0.18% Co.

Broad intervals of PGE mineralisation have been confirmed in all holes drilled to date at the Intrusion and
disseminated sulphides (trace to 3% on average) have been identified down to ~450m below surface.
Disseminated sulphide zones intersected to date have a grade range of 0.5-2.0g/t PGEs, 0.1-0.2% Ni, 0.050.15% Cu and <0.05% Co. In general, metal content appears to show a positive correlation with sulphur
content and levels of potentially deleterious elements (arsenic, cadmium, selenium) are all low.

Weathering appears to extend down to ~30-40m below surface and a well-developed saprolite profile
after serpentinite contains elevated PGE grades (ranging from 1.2-4.5g/t PGEs) from near surface to a
depth of ~25m.
About Platinum Group Elements and Palladium

The Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) are a group of six precious metals clustered together on the periodic
table: platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), osmium (Os), rhodium (Rh) and ruthenium (Ru).
PGEs have many desirable properties and as such have a wide variety of applications. Most notably, they
are used as auto-catalysts (pollution control devices for vehicles), but are also used in jewellery, electronics
and hydrogen fuel cells.
Palladium is very rare and is currently one of the most valuable precious metals, with an acute supply
shortage driving prices to a recent record high of US$2,856/oz in February 2020. The current spot price is
approximately US$1,900/oz.
Strong demand growth (~11.5Moz in 2019 1) is being driven by regulations requiring increased use of the
metal, particularly as an auto-catalyst in gasoline and gasoline-hybrid vehicles. The total palladium market
supply from all sources in 2019 was ~10.8Moz, and >75% is sourced from mines in Russia and South Africa1.

In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has
been done this would be relatively simple
(eg. ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to
obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire
assay’). In other cases more explanation
may be required, such as where there is
coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg. submarine nodules)
may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.

Diamond drill core samples were taken
over selective intervals ranging from 0.2m
to 1.2m (typically 1.0m). Qualitative care
taken when sampling diamond drill core
to sample the same half of the drill core.
Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling samples
were collected as 1m samples. Two 1m
assay samples were collected as a split
from the rig cyclone using a cone splitter
and are typically 3kg in weight.
Soil geochemical samples were collected
by auger with a maximum depth of
sample of 7m in areas of deep sand
cover. Two samples were selected at
each location with a fine fraction (-80#
mesh) and a coarse fraction (+3/16 inch
mesh).

Drilling has been undertaken by diamond
and Reverse Circulation (RC) techniques.
Diamond drill core is HQ size (63.5mm
diameter) with triple tube used from
surface and standard tube in competent
bedrock.
Core orientation is by an ACT Reflex (ACT II
RD) tool
RC Drilling uses a face-sampling hammer
drill bit with a diameter of 5.5 inches
(140mm).
Individual recoveries of diamond drill core
samples were recorded on a qualitative
basis. Generally sample weights are
comparable and any bias is considered
negligible.
Individual recoveries for RC composite
samples were recorded on a qualitative
basis. Sample weights were slightly lower
through transported cover whereas drilling
through bedrock yielded samples with
more consistent weights.
No relationships have been evident
between diamond core, RC sample
grade and recoveries.
All drill holes were logged geologically

including, but not limited to; weathering,
regolith, lithology, structure, texture,
alteration and mineralisation. Logging was
at an appropriate quantitative standard
for reconnaissance exploration.
Logging is considered qualitative in
nature.
All holes were geologically logged in full.
Diamond drill core is photographed wet
and dry before cutting.
Diamond core was sawn in half and onehalf quartered and selectively sampled
over 0.2-1.2m intervals (mostly 1m).
Diamond drill core field duplicates
collected as ¼ core.
RC assay samples were collected as two
1m splits from the rig cyclone via a cone
splitter. The cone splitter was horizontal to
ensure sample representivity. Wet or damp
samples were noted in the sample logging
sheet and a majority of samples were dry.
Sample preparation is industry standard
and comprises oven drying, jaw crushing
and pulverising to -75 microns (80% pass).
Field duplicates were collected from
selected sulphide zones as a second 1m
split directly from the cone splitter.
Drill sample sizes are considered
appropriate for the style of mineralisation
sought and the nature of the drilling
program.
Auger soil sampling procedures are
considered to be industry standard
techniques and appropriate for
reconnaissance exploration.
Diamond drill core and RC samples
underwent sample preparation and
geochemical analysis by ALS Perth. Au-PtPd was analysed by 50g fire assay fusion
with an ICP-AES finish (ALS Method code
PGM-ICP24). A 48-element suite was
analysed by ICP-MS following a four-acid
digest (ALS method code ME-MS61)
including Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce,
Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, K, La, Li,
Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, S,
Sb, Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y,
Zn, Zr. Additional ore-grade analysis was
performed as required for elements
reporting out of range for Ni, Cr, Cu (ALS
method code ME-OG-62) and Pd, Pt (ALS
method code PGM-ICP27).
Auger soil samples were analysed for a
suite of elements by aqua regia digest
with an ICP-AES finish. Pt, Pd and Au were
analysed by fire assay with an ICP-MS
finish using a 30g charge.

Certified analytical standards and blanks
were inserted at appropriate intervals for
diamond, RC drill samples and auger soil
samples
Approximately 5% of samples submitted
for analysis comprised QAQC control
samples.
Significant drill intersections are checked
by the Project Geologist and then by the
General Manager Exploration. Significant
intersections are cross-checked with the
logged geology and drill core after final
assays are received.
One RC was tinned with a diamond hole
to provide drill core for metallurgical
testwork. These holes are were also useful
as a comparison between
grade/thickness variations over a 5m
separation between drill holes.
Primary drill data was collected as hard
copy records in the field and digitised at
the Chalice Perth office where the data is
validated and entered into the master
database.
A 10g/t Au top-cut has been applied to
diamond drill core assays. No other
adjustments were made to the assay data
received.
Diamond and RC drill hole collar locations
are initially recorded by Chalice
employees using a handheld GPS with a
+/- 3m margin of error.
Auger soil samples locations were
collected using a handheld GPS.
DGPS collar pick-ups replace handheld
GPS collar pick-ups and have <1m margin
of error.
The grid system used for the location of all
drill holes is GDA94 - MGA (Zone 50). The
grid system used for stream sediment
samples was WGS84 (UTM).
RLs were assigned either from 1 sec (30m)
satellite data or DGPS pick-ups.
Diamond drill holes were typically
positioned as close to orthogonal to the
interpreted dip and strike of the known
zone of mineralisation.
Results from the drilling to date are not
considered sufficient to assume any
geological or grade continuity.
Auger soil samples were collected on a
nominal 100m x 50m spacing with infill
samples collected at 25m x 50m spacing
as part of an orientation survey.
No compositing undertaken for diamond
drill core or RC samples.

•

The orientation of the mineralisation
reported in diamond and RC drill hole
results is interpreted as close to orthogonal
to the drill holes. JD010 is orientated
about 55 degrees to strike due to site
access constraints.

Exploration activities are conducted over
E70/5118 and 5119 on private property.
CGM (WA) Pty Ltd, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Chalice Gold Mines Limited
with no known encumbrances.
Current drilling is on private land and
granted tenure covers both private land
and State Forest.
Access for exploration in the State Forest
requires Ministerial approval which has
not yet been obtained.
Limited exploration has been completed
by other exploration parties in the vicinity
of the targets identified by Chalice to
date.
Chalice has compiled historical records
dating back to the early 1960’s which
indicate only three genuine explorers in
the area, all primarily targeting Fe-Ti-V
mineralisation.
Over 1971-1972, Garrick Agnew Pty Ltd
undertook reconnaissance surface
sampling over prominent aeromagnetic
anomalies in a search for ‘Coates deposit
style’ vanadium mineralisation. Surface
sampling methodology is not described in
detail, nor were analytical methods
specified, with samples analysed for V2O5,
Ni, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn, results of which are
referred to in this announcement.
Three diamond holes were completed by
Bestbet Pty Ltd targeting Fe-Ti-V situated
approximately 3km NE of JRC001. No
elevated Ni-Cu-PGE assays were
reported.
Bestbet Pty Ltd undertook 27 stream
sediment samples within E70/5119.
Elevated levels of palladium were noted
in the coarse fraction (-5mm+2mm) are

Information

•

A summary of all information material to
the understanding of the exploration
results including a tabulation of the
following information for all Material drill
holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole
collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level –
elevation above sea level in metres) of
the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception
depth
o hole length.
If the exclusion of this information is justified
on the basis that the information is not
Material and this exclusion does not
detract from the understanding of the
report, the Competent Person should
clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting
averaging techniques, maximum and/or
minimum grade truncations (eg. cutting of
high grades) and cut-off grades are
usually Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate
short lengths of high-grade results and
longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation
should be stated and some typical
examples of such aggregations should be
shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of
metal equivalent values should be clearly
stated.
These relationships are particularly
important in the reporting of Exploration
Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its
nature should be reported.

reported in this release. Finer fraction
samples did not replicate the coarse
fraction results.
A local AMAG survey was flown in 1996
by Alcoa using 200m line spacing which
has been used by Chalice for targeting
purposes.
The target deposit type is a magmatic NiCu-PGE sulphide deposit, within the
Yilgarn Craton. The style of sulphide
mineralisation intersected consists of
massive, matrix, stringer and disseminated
sulphides typical of metamorphosed and
structurally overprinted magmatic Ni
sulphide deposits.

Significant intercepts are reported using a
>0.3g/t Pd length-weighted cut off. A
maximum of 4m internal dilution has been
applied.
A 10 g/t Au top cut has been applied to
drill assay results.
Metal equivalent values are not reported.

All widths are quoted down-hole.
All drill holes were orientated to be as
close as possible to orthogonal to the
interpreted dip of the mineralised zone(s)
and/or targets.

If it is not known and only the down hole
lengths are reported, there should be a
clear statement to this effect (eg. ‘down
hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with
scales) and tabulations of intercepts
should be included for any significant
discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and
appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and
high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including (but
not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test
results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics;
potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.
The nature and scale of planned further
work (eg. tests for lateral extensions or
depth extensions or large-scale step-out
drilling).
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of
possible extensions, including the main
geological interpretations and future
drilling areas, provided this information is
not commercially sensitive.

•

Refer to figures in the body of text.

•

All significant intercepts have been
reported.

•

A high temperature SQUID EM survey was
undertaken by GEM Geophysics utilising
two fixed-loops with the configuration of
1330m x 1000m (Nth) and 740m x 1000m
(Sth) with stations read at 150m x 50m
intervals. A total of 299 stations recorded
using a Jessy Deeps HTS receiver at 0.25Hz
and 60 A.

•

Diamond and RC drilling will continue to
test high-priority EM conductors, soil
geochemical targets. Further drilling
along strike and down dip may occur at
these and other targets depending on
results.
Down-hole EM surveying will be carried
out on the majority of diamond and
selective RC drill holes to test for off-hole
conductors. Subsequent holes will
undergo down-hole EM if required.
Any potential extensions to mineralisation
are shown in the figures in the body of the
text.
