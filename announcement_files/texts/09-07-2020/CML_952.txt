Visible Gold Intersected at Lorraine in Drill Hole CM-20-02


Fine-grained visible gold has been recorded at 462m in an intense silica-carbonate alteration
zone in hole CM-20-02 (Figure 1);



The hole was deepened from its planned depth of 400m and terminated at 513m due to
intermittent zones of alteration and silicification in the footwall rocks;



An image of the altered zone containing the visible gold (Figure 2) provided visual correlation
with the description of a high-grade intercept, namely 1m at 53.47g/t Au and 12g/t Ag from the
circa 1967 underground hole U-6-76, i.e. low sulphide content and fine visible gold;



Due to personnel changes the hole has only been detail logged and photographed to 358m
downhole. Based on hole CM-20-01 the original Target Zone is at approximately 380-390m.



The discovery of this footwall alteration zone has opened up significant additional potential for
gold mineralisation to be hosted at Lorraine, which is completely separate to the original contact
target zone.

Chase Mining Corporation Limited (“CML” or “The Company”) provides the following update on the
progress of the Lorraine Mine Gold Project diamond drill programme targeting the gold (plus copper
and silver) mineralisation reported from historic sampling and limited drilling associated with the 6-Level
development of the Lorraine Nickel Mine in Southwestern Quebec (ASX Announcements 9 June and
1, 3 and 6 July 2020).
Diamond drillhole CM-20-02 was completed at 513m (Figure 3). Based on hole CM-20-01 the original
Target Zone is at approximately 380-390m downhole, but due to personnel changes the hole was only
detail logged and photographed to 358m last night and once the rest is complete, the core will be cut,
photographed and sampled for assay.
The decision to deepen hole CM-20-02 was to further evaluate the footwall basalts following the
intersection of the 8m breccia zone logged from ~360m downhole to end of hole in CM-20-01 and test
for additional potential mineralisation in the mine footwall. Due to intermittent zones of alteration and
silicification in the footwall rocks (including the zone intense alteration at ~462m containing the visible
gold), the hole was extended to a final depth of 513m. Further comments on the Target Zone and the
new alteration zone will be made once the detail logs and core photographs are received.

Figure 2: The visible gold at 462m is reported from the quartz-chlorite vein in the centre of the middle
stick of core. Note the overall alteration and intense milky quartz / silica alteration bottom right of the
core tray.

Discussion
The presence of fine-grained visible gold at 462m in a zone of silica-carbonate altered footwall rocks
with only minor sulphide content allows for the visual correlation with the description of a high-grade
intercept, namely 1m at 53.47g/t Au and 12g/t Ag from the circa 1967 underground hole U-6-76, i.e.
low sulphide content and fine visible gold.
The discovery of this footwall alteration zone has opened up significant additional potential for gold
mineralisation to be hosted at Lorraine, which is completely separate to the original contact target zone.

Further Work
Hole CM-20-03 has commenced and once it has been completed, the drill rig will continue with planned
hole CM-20-04.
Given the alteration and silicification that was encountered at depth in CM-20-02, both holes CM-2003 and CM-20-04 will be deepened from their original planned depths pending hole CM-20-02’s detail
logs and sampling. Similarly, if warranted hole CM-20-01 will be deepened to a corresponding depth
after completion of hole CM-20-04.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)

Criteria

Sampling
techniques

JORC Code explanation


Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement
tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments,
etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the
broad meaning of sampling.



Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.



Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.



In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this
would be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling
was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases, more explanation may be required, such as where
there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems.
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.

Commentary


At this stage of the drill programme only visual logging of drill
core is reported in this ASX announcement.



The commentary detailed in this Table 1 Report pertains to the
Company’s SOP for reporting diamond drilling, logging,
sampling and logistical management and assaying of drill core
from the current (2020) Lorraine drill programme.


