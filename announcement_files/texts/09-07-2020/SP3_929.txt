Key Risks - General
COVID-19

Events related to the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have resulted in significant market volatility. There is continued uncertainty as to ongoing and future
response of governments and authorities globally as well as a likelihood of an Australian economic recession of unknown duration or severity. As such, the full
impact of COVID-19 to consumer behaviour, suppliers, employees and the Company are not fully known. Given this, the impact of COVID-19 could potentially be
materially adverse to Spectur’s financial and operational performance.

Competition

The solar power, visual AI and IOT industry is subject to competition based on factors including price, service, quality, performance standards, information
security, innovation and the ability to provide customers with an appropriate range of reliable and tailored services in a timely manner.

Competition from new
entrants to the industry

Spectur operates in an increasingly competitive industry where a number of participants are, or may, target entry into the industry with new and innovative
products aimed at the industry. New entrants to the industry may offer more competitive prices for products due to a range of factors, including if they have
greater financial resources than Spectur, which may enable them to offer products at more competitive prices while they establish their business. New entrants
may also compete against Spectur with cheaper products that have less functionality than Spectur’s offering.

Failure to retain existing
customers and attract
new customers

Spectur’s business is dependent on its ability to retain its existing customers and attract new customers. Part of Spectur’s business operates under subscription
models which are exposed to the risk of termination, expiry and non-renewal.

Spectur is not yet
profit making

Spectur has historically focused on developing its platform and product, growing its customer base through relationships with channel partners, and the
recruitment of sales and marketing staff. While revenue has grown from FY14 to FY19, the focus on revenue growth has seen an increase in the cost base, resulting
in the business historically generating NPAT losses and an expectation that NPAT losses will continue in the future. If Spectur fails to generate positive NPAT in the
future it may be required to raise further capital and Spectur’s future operations may be adversely affected and its reputation may be damaged.

Reliance on
product line

Spectur’s business model is substantially reliant upon a limited range of products, being the HD and new STA systems. Spectur’s success depends on its ability to
keep customers satisfied with its products. There is a risk that Spectur fails to properly maintain its products and IOT services or that updates or new releases may
introduce errors or performance issues which could cause customer dissatisfaction and damage to reputation. Spectur’s reputation may also suffer as a result of
real or perceived reductions in functionality, product quality, reliability, security, value and customer support or a failure to reflect developments in technology or
in the commercial, compliance and regulatory environment. Any of these factors may result in reduced sales and usage, loss of customers and an inability to
attract new customers and possibly legal claims by customers.

Reliance on third party IT
suppliers and disruption of
technology systems

Spectur and its customers are dependent on the performance, reliability and availability of Spectur’s IOT technology platforms and communications systems
(including third party provider of servers, the internet, telecommunication providers, data centre hosting services and the cloud environment in which Spectur
provides its services). There is a risk that these systems may be adversely affected by disruption, failure, service outages or data corruption that could occur as a
result of computer viruses, malware, cyber attacks or other disruptions including natural disasters, power outages or other similar events.

Key Risks - General
Security breach and data
privacy
Ability to attract and
retain key staff
General Risk

Investment Risk

SPECTUR LIMITED (ASX: SP3)

Spectur’s products involve the storage and transmission of customers’ confidential and proprietary information. Spectur’s business could be materially
impacted by security breaches of customers’ data and information, either by unauthorised access, theft, destruction, loss of information or
misappropriation or release of confidential customer data.
Spectur’s success depends to a significant extent on its key personnel, in particular the senior management team. Spectur’s senior management have
extensive experience in the core and unique operations of the business. The loss of key members of senior management may adversely affect Spectur’s
ability to develop its products or implement its business strategies and may adversely affect its future financial performance.
An investment in Spectur is also subject to general risks including those related to general economic conditions, availability of funding, refinancing
requirements, foreign exchange risk, share price volatility, interest rates, debt financial distress of customers, attracting and retaining employees, health,
safety and environment issues, litigation and disputes, financial forecasts, regulatory issues, changes in law, changes in accounting policy and standards,
taxation implications, insurance issues, force majeure, counterparty risk, intellectual property risk and reputational risk.
There are general risks associated with investments in equity capital such as Spectur shares. The trading price of Spectur shares may fluctuate with
movements in equity capital markets in Australia and internationally. This may result in the market price for the New Shares being less or more than the
Offer Price. Generally applicable factors which may affect the market price of Spectur shares include:
• the impact of COVID-19 (or other pandemics or epidemics), including prolonged reduction in activity in the business’ key markets and on Spectur’s
workforce, industry, customers and supply chains, including as a result of governmental action, work stoppages, lockdowns, quarantines, travel
restrictions and the impact on the economics and share markets of the key markets in which Spectur operates;
• general movements in Australian and international stock markets;
• investor sentiment;
• Australian and international economic conditions and outlook;
• changes in interest rates and the rate of inflation;
• changes in government legislation and policies, including taxation laws;
• loss of key personnel and delays in replacement;
• announcement of new technologies;
• epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19;
• geo political instability, including international hostilities and acts of terrorism, the response to COVID-19 and travel restrictions;
• demand for and supply of Spectur shares;
• announcements and results of competitors; and analyst reports.
No assurances can be given that the New Shares will trade at or above the Offer price. None of Spectur, its directors or any other person guarantees the
market performance of the New Shares. The financial position, performance and prospects of Spectur and Spectur’s share price may be adversely affected
by the worsening of general economic conditions in Australia (including, the adverse impacts of, and the responses to, COVID-19), as well as international
market conditions and related factors. It is also possible new risks might emerge as a result of Australian or global markets experiencing extreme stress, or
existing risks may manifest themselves in ways that are not currently foreseeable.
