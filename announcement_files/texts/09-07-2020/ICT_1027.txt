iCollege Limited Quarterly Cash Flow
-

Cash receipts of ~$2.7m which includes $400k of government stimulus despite Covid 19 upheaval
FY2020 cash receipts exceed $11.2m
Successful COVID-19 response plan now facilitating progressive return to classroom learning

The Board and Executive of iCollege Limited (‘iCollege’ or ‘the company’) (ASX: ICT) is pleased to report on
operational and financial performance for the quarter ended 30 June 2020 and provide an update on current
activities.
Financial performance
The company recorded cash receipts for the quarter of $2,700,771 (normalised cash receipts were $2,334,617
after removing $396,154 of government stimulus) which is down from $3,170,000 in the prior quarter but
almost double the cash receipts of the previous corresponding quarter (June quarter 2019: $1,215,000).
Additional commentary around the contributing factors to the lower cash receipts for the quarter is further
explained below in the student recruitment update and Managing Directors comments.
This is a particularly strong performance for the company and achieved in a period of unprecedented business
disruption. While the operating divisions faced multiple rolling challenges in the quarter, including the
movement of students to online training and the closure of most campuses, iCollege delivered unaudited
revenue for FY2020 of approximately $11,300,000 .
iCollege ended the quarter with cash at bank of $845k. This was due to aggressive cost management initiatives,
stable cash receipts from continuing business operations and government stimulus.

Student recruitment update
International student recruitment
The company noticed a predictable slowing of international student enrolments during the quarter. This can
be directly attributed to the closure of Australian borders and increased competition for the students already
within Australia. There is still a steady flow of student enquiries being received through the marketing team
and the company is expecting enrolments to improve by Q2 FY 20/21.
Domestic student recruitment
As mentioned in the previous quarterly update, iCollege's revenue is generated from its international student
business (51%) and its government subsidised, domestic student business (49%).
Domestic enrolments remained steady for the quarter with Capital Training Institute and Celtic Training
continuing to contribute significantly.
During the first two quarters of FY2021, the company expects to witness increased demand for domestic
training. We expect that Capital Training Institute, the registered training organisation that delivers Building
and Construction training from Certificate III to Advanced Diploma, to benefit from the federal government’s
building stimulus and see an upturn in the number of enrolments. Celtic Training, which delivers Certificate III
through to Diploma in Health and Community Services is already experiencing a strong demand for places in
courses being run in Queensland and South Australia. With a strong need for additional aged care and medical
support staff we expect this part of the business to expand rapidly following further relaxation on restrictions.
Corrections training recommences in Queensland
As highlighted in the previous quarterly report, since 2016, iCollege has been running a bespoke training
package within the Queensland Correctional Services facilities. The training course was specifically designed
against the AQF Foundation Skills training package to assist inmates prepare themselves for employment after
their release. This has been a highly successful program operating in five of Queensland’s 11 Correctional
facilities and it is a program of which we are most proud.
Courses were scheduled to continue through March and into Q4, however on Friday 27 March 2020, all
correctional facilities in Queensland were closed to non-essential personnel in response to COVID-19. On the
15th of June these restrictions were lifted, with the training team developing their own COVID Safe Plan and
ensuring compliance with the Department of Corrections plan. This includes suitable social distancing and
temperature checks before being allowed to enter the facility. During the last two weeks of June, the team did
an outstanding job of completing all students' course work for those who had begun courses prior to the COVID
19 shutdown. This enormous effort on behalf of the corrections team saw revenue of $117,000 being generated
from the lifting of entry restrictions in facilities on the 15th to the 30th of June.
COVID – 19 impact on operations
Beginning in March, the company developed a COVID-19 response and action plan with the main objective of
the plan being to ensure the health and safety of all staff and students. This plan was effectively implemented
in a staged fashion to ensure minimal disruption to students This proved successful with much of the student

feedback being very positive. These steps have provided the business with an excellent result of ZERO cases of
COVID-19 in students, staff or anyone associated with the company. The steps taken include:
ELICOS (English Language Training)
•
All students were asked to stay at home and study remotely with classes being delivered on the Zoom
platform from 27 March 2020.
•
With easing of restrictions and available classroom space, students were invited to return to class or
continue to study remotely via Zoom with trainers at the campus East Coast 1 June 2020 and West Coast 8 June
2020.
•
Students have been advised that we are now switching back to full face-to-face delivery from 6 July
2020 as restrictions eased. Attending campus will now be a requirement of their course.
International Vocational training
•
All students were asked to stay at home and study remotely with classes being delivered utilising the
Zoom platform and the existing Learning Management System as at 27 March 2020.
•
Students have been advised that practical sessions will resume in the kitchens on 20 July 2020. Classes
will be resized to ensure compliance with government recommendations.
•
The Zoom platform will still be utilised to deliver training, but students have been invited to attend
class at the campuses from 20July 2020.
•
Students will be returning to full face to face delivery end of term 3, on October 26 after student
holidays.
In a recent letter to students, National Operations Manager Dallas Kenn commented: “There has been
significant relaxions announced recently in both Queensland and Western Australia which may suggest a return
to our kitchens is on the agenda. As you all know, COVID19 is not something that is predictable, and we must
make sure we are not placing ourselves in a vulnerable position by returning to normal operations whilst the
world searches for a cure. Whilst we watch and monitor government guidelines, we must also plan to bring
some normality back to our workplace. The senior leadership team has formulated a provisional plan following
the proposed timelines for staff and students to return to campus.”

Celtic Training classes in Individual Care (Aged) for domestic students continued to be delivered out

6 July 2020
•
Hospitality trainers return to classroom and practical kitchen training and assessment schedule
(Classes resume 20 July 2020).
iCollege will continue to take advice from government agencies and the regulator ensuring that we provide the
safest possible training facilities for staff and students.
iCollege is pleased to advise that following significant communications with Minister Cash's office, we have
now met with the Minister to discuss a potential support package for the International Student Skills and
Vocational sector. A level of support from the government will be important to position the sector in Australia
as the number one destination for students when government deems the situation safe to open the borders.
We look forward to providing further advice as matters develop.
When the restrictions relating to COVID-19 are eased or lifted, we expect to see a significant number of
international students who have remained in Australia looking at their situation closely which may see many
students seeking to change education providers. There is an opportunity for iCollege to become the college of
choice for these students and the company’s marketing team have been working closely with our significant
agent base to provide support to students when we return to the classroom. Marketing activities have
continued through the shutdown and we are witnessing a steady level of new applications for courses offered
by iCollege.
Government initiatives and stimulus packages
iCollege’s Board and finance team have been successful with their applications for several government
initiatives and stimulus measures. These include:
•

ATO cash-flow boost: A cash flow boost from the ATO of $150,000 has been received during this
quarter

•

•

Payments to related parties and their associates

For personal use only

Payments for executive director fees for the quarter totalled $90,000, representing $45,000 each paid to
Managing Director Ash Katta and Executive Director Badri Gosavi.
Payments of $2475 to associates included legal fees paid to HWL Ebsworth in which Chairman, Simon Tolhurst
is a partner. Fees paid were at normal market rates.
Management commentary
Managing Director Ash Katta said: “Despite the unprecedent challenges posed to the business in the quarter
where the full impact of COVID-19 has been felt, our cash receipts have fared remarkably well. This reflects the
diverse nature of our revenue base, our ability to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and our
dedicated staff."
“I am most encouraged with the extraordinary display of teamwork that has allowed the business to come
through this particularly challenging time. Each staff member has been important to the transition from
classroom training to online and now back again. The business is in a stable position to move forward into the
coming financial year with a solid financial foundation and a fully determined workforce. Our cohort of loyal
students who have remained in Australia have worked closely with us and adapted very well to the online
delivery of programs using both the Learning Management System and Zoom video delivery platform. Our
accounts department has worked tirelessly to redesign payment plans and give students every opportunity to
meet their financial obligations. This has been no small task. The effort made by the entire team has ensured
that we can return to the ‘new normal’ that keeps our staff and students healthy and safe.”
“We will continue to provide updates as the year unfolds. COVID-19 is an evolving situation and iCollege’s board
and management team is working hard to underpin current operations, actively assess new revenue streams
and ensure the company remains a trusted and dependable education provider that delivers for all its
stakeholders.”
This announcement approved by the board of iCollege Limited.
