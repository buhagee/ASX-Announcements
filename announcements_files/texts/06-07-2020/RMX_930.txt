Red Mountain Mining Limited (ASX:RMX) (the Company) is pleased to advise that it has entered into a
binding term sheet to acquire 100% of the Mt Maitland Gold Project in Western Australia.
Situated within 50km of major gold mining operations, the Mt Maitland Gold Project comprises a 62km2
parcel of tenure located approximately 90km north of Meekatharra in the Murchison Goldfield, Western
Australia (see Figure 1). It contains two mineralised shear zones over a strike length of 19km within an
Archean greenstone belt.

Background
The Mt Maitland Project is situated at a major geological plate tectonic boundary reflecting the collision
between the separate Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons. The junction of the Yilgarn Craton (Archean) and the
Capricorn Orogen (Proterozoic) in Western Australia is highly prospective for both gold and copper.
The Project covers almost the entirety of Mt Maitland Greenstone Belt in the world class province of the
Murchison Region in the mid-west of Western Australia (see Figure 2). The belt extends over roughly 23
x 4 km and is represented by the Maitland synformal structure which is the northernmost greenstone belt
of the Yilgarn Craton.
The majority of known mineral deposits in the region are spatially associated with the surface expression
of these major crustal suture zones and other lithospheric-scale faults. These faults are instructive for the
transport and deposition of economic mineralisation.

Figure 2: Mt Maitland Project Area
Gold Mining at Mt Maitland
Gold was first discovered in the area in 1898 in high grade quartz veins, and production has predominantly
taken place at two main prospect locations, Mt Maitland North and Mt Maitland South. Records exist
only from 1933 however gold production is noted as having an average grade of 19.3g/t Au.
Historical gold workings are restricted to shallow shafts, small stopes, pits and diggings, predominantly at
Maitland North and Maitland South. At Maitland North, gold mineralisation is hosted by a laminated
quartz vein within a deformed BIF. The gold workings occur over a strike length of 600m, with stopes
targeting easily mined high grade gold over 40m. At Maitland South similar shallow gold workings occur
over a strike of approximately 400m.
These gold mineralised systems have had limited drilling and the project remains ineffectively tested. The
scale of the strike extensive gold anomalism associated with this gold mineralising system and grade of
the known gold deposits is encouraging.
Although previous explorers recommended further work in the areas encompassing the Maitland North,
Maitland and Maitland South workings, little follow-up work has ever been undertaken. Systematic
methodological exploration to effectively and conclusively test both these gold mining centres and
potential repetitions along strike is warranted.

Exploration Activity and Prospects
Exploration since the 1960’s, through surface geochemical sampling and limited sub-surface drill testing
has identified several prospects along two major regional structures at the Mt Maitland project (Figures
3 and 4).
The most recent exploration work was undertaken by Talisman Mines in 2011. Drill intercepts at the Mt
Maitland South prospect include 12m at 1.58 g/t Au from 8m including 2m at 6.35g/t Au (Figure 3,
Appendix 1). Other work included a comprehensive geochemical sampling programme across the Mt
Maitland Project including soil sampling and rock chipping.
The central portion of the eastern structure is marked by a linear succession of old gold shows worked
since the late 1800’s. These include Maitland North, Lenanphyl, Muddawerrie and Second Chance (Figures
2, 3 and 4). Artisanal prospector style recovery of gold above the water table was undertaken through
workings consisting of mine shafts, stopes and shallow pits. Several high grade rockchip samples have
been returned from these.
Substantial rock chip anomalism and multielement soil exists at Mt Maitland (see Figures 3 and 4). Goldin-soil anomalism is pervasive and extends for many kilometres along the interpreted structures. The
anomalies coloured red in Figure 4 are strongly elevated in gold (>5ppb gold) and extend over 13km,
demonstrating the scale and extent of the gold mineralising system

On the western structure historical exploration has identified extensive high grade copper-gold
anomalism from rockchip and channel sampling which remains to be followed up (Figure 3, Appendix 2).
Channel samples taken across the mineralized veins returned 2.5m at 22.7 g/t at Maitland North and
0.75m at 61.8 g/t at Maitland South. A number of rockchips above 10 g/t have also been reported. The
western area also contains peak gold-in-soil values of 2724ppb Au and anomalous copper in soils and rock
chip samples (up to 8.82% Cu, Appendix 2).
The main gold mineralised zone at Mt Maitland South is vertically dipping with a strike length of at least
440m and is closed off to the south by a cross-cutting dolerite intrusion. It is possible that mineralisation
extends to the south beyond the mafic intrusion, but this remains untested to date. Subsequent to
Talisman’s maiden drilling programme at Mt Maitland, the company proceeded to focus on its flagship
projects within the gold province of the Murchison Region.
Data from previous exploration has largely not been compiled into digital and GIS formats. The summary
above is based on an initial review of data provided and further data may be identified in exploration data
to be compiled over coming weeks to aid target generation and design of work programmes. It should be
noted that data may be identified in this process which changes the interpretations presented here and
that certain data, in particular rockchip sampling, is by its nature likely not to be representative of the
tenor of gold mineralisation. However, the overview above is included to give a summary of the potential
of the Mt Maitland project.
The majority of the project remains effectively untested with limited drill testing. Identification and
development of relatively low capex, near surface mineralisation has the potential to provide early cash
flow. The Mt Maitland Project is located 51km from WestGold Resources Fortnum Gold Project (FGP),
with potential for toll processing scenarios, with more positive resource development having potential to
support a stand-alone plant.
Overall, while limited and shallow, historic mining and past exploration results clearly demonstrate that
the Mt Maitland project has the potential to be strongly mineralised and work to date has yielded 9 walkup drill prospects.
Transaction Terms
The Company shall pay a $50,000 exclusivity fee in order to conduct due diligence over a 21 day
period. Following satisfactory due diligence (entirely at RMX’s discretion), RMX may acquire 100% of the
Project for $250,000. The vendor of the Project is a geologist, Mr Simon Jones, and is unrelated to the
Company.
In accordance with the Mining Act WA, completion of the transaction and transfer of EL is conditional on
ministerial approval.
No performance milestones or other fees are payable in connection with the transaction.
Next Steps
RMX shall continue its technical due diligence including a site visit which will include rock chip sampling
across several of the prospects. As part of the due diligence process, the Company shall undertake a

comprehensive review of historic production and exploration data which shall culminate in a ranking of
drill targets as part of a defined exploration strategy.

Data sourced from WAMEX reports as detailed in the table
These results should be read in conjunction with the information in Appendix 3 as prescribed by the JORC Code
Specifically a number of the sample locations are only recorded on historical plans and plotted relative to historical workings or other landmarks
The exact location of these samples will require field checking however results are included here to illustrate the potential of the prospects under
discussion. The approximate coordinate of the prospect being sampled have been inserted in italics as a guide, the actual location is anticipated to be
within 400 metres of this coordinate.

Appendix 3. JORC Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria

JORC Code explanation

Commentary

Sampling
techniques

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or
specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate
to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity
and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the
Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be
relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1
m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge
for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.

• Various phases of exploration over the past 120 years has been
undertaken over the ground the subject of EL 51/1900.
• Geochemical sampling has consisted of regional soil, stream, rock
chip sampling, in addition to selective grab and channel sampling
sourcing material from shallow open pits, mine shafts, mine tailings
and prospector workings within the projects area.
• Soil sampling results reported in this announcement were from
programmes completed between 2007 and 2011 by Talisman Mining.
• Rock chip samples were taken from outcrops to test features of
geological interest
• Channel samples were taken across veins exposed within old
workings
• Drill samples have been sourced from RAB and RC drilling
• RAB drilling was sampled by composite sampling, the MRAB series
(NCR, 1989) was sampled on intervals between 2 and 8 metres and
the RAB series (Metex, 1993) was sampled as either 2m or 6m
composites.
• RC drilling was sampled on a 1m basis, with composite samples
collected and submitted as an initial test for mineralisation.

Drilling
techniques

• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air

• The data is not appropriate for use in estimating a Mineral Resource
and is not intended for such use. There has been insufficient
exploration to define a Mineral Resource.
• Sample compositing has not been applied.

structure

• Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of
possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering
the deposit type.
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation
of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a
sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.

body being Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation.
• There is an application for amalgamation lodged with the Department
of Mines, Industry regulation and Safety (DMIRS). over E51/1900,
submitted to amalgamate dead prospecting licence (P51/2936) into
exploration licence 51/1900. An objection has been lodged against
this amalgamation by the Native Title Party.
• The tenure is in good standing with the DMIRS.

Exploration
done by other
parties

• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.

• The Mt Maitland Project area has an extensive exploration history
dating back to the late 1800’s when Maitland North and Maitland
South were mined intermittently from 1897. Modern gold exploration
over the project area has been conducted by several companies with
Talisman Mining being the most recent.
• The general area that forms the subject of this report has been
explored in the past by various companies including Pancontinental
Mining, North Coolgardie Resources, Metex Resources and Talisman
Mining Ltd during the period 1987 to 2011.

Geology

• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.

• The project covers the Mount Maitland Greenstone Belt at the
northern margin of the Yilgarn Craton. The Mt Maitland Project is
situated at a major geological plate tectonic boundary reflecting the
collision between the separate Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons. It is
bounded by major regional structural faults - to the north by the
Murchison Fault, to the west by the Yalgar Fault and to the south by
the Mt Maitland Fault. The Murchison Fault separates the Proterozoic
southern Capricorn Orogen from the Archean northern Yilgarn
Craton. The Yalgar Fault separates the older Narryer Terrane from

the Murchison Domain.
• The Mt Maitland Greenstone Belt extends over roughly 23 x 4 km and
is represented by the Maitland synformal structure which is the
northernmost greenstone belt of the Yilgarn Craton.
• The Mt Maitland Greenstone Belt is an arcuate 3km thick succession
of interlayered mafic-ultramafic igneous intrusives and volcanics, and
felsic volcanic rocks with several intercalated sedimentary rocks and
BIFs. The sequence has been folded and regionally metamorphosed
to upper-greenschist/mid-amphibolite grade. Extensive Proterozoic
dolerite dykes cross-cut the project area related to massive gabbroic
intrusive bodies.
• A regional splay structure off the mantle tapping Murchison Fault
traverses the entire length of the tenement.
• Pervasive quartz veins occur along this splay structure.
• Orogenic gold mineralisation in the area is associated with quartz
veining +/- sulphides and enveloping hydrothermal mineralisation
haloes within sheared mafic-ultramafic igneous intrusives and
volcanics, and sedimentary rocks (including BIF) and felsic volcanic
rocks.
• E51/1900 covers almost the entirety of the Mt Maitland Greenstone
Belt.
The central half of the tenement comprises outcrop and sub-cropping
basement with alluvial and colluvial cover in the northern and southern
parts.
Drill hole
Information

• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the
exploration results including a tabulation of the following information
for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.

explain why this is the case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used
for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of
such aggregations should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true
width not known’).

• Aggregation has been done on a length weighted basis.

• Drilling was carried out perpendicular to the observed trend of
mineralisation or the regional stratigraphy.
• Channel sampling was carried out perpendicular to the trend of
mineralised veins.
• In both cases, while efforts have been made to achieve unbiased
sampling of mineralisation the controls on mineralisation are not well
known enough to comment as to whether a sampling bias has been
introduced or not. Further exploration will be required to determine
the primary geological structures controlling mineralisation..

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.

• Diagrams have been included in the text of the announcement.

• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential
deleterious or contaminating substances.

• A substantial amount of historical data has been collected over the Mt
Maitland Project. A large amount of this data is not in digital, with
some assay/sampling data recorded only on plans, and therefore will
be compiled by the Company as part of its due diligence into the
project. The majority of this data is geological mapping and surface
geochemical sampling. The full historic surface sampling dataset is
still being validated and will be reviewed and reported once this is
