New phase of exploration to test both advanced and early-stage targets
Venturex Resources Ltd (Venturex or the Company) (ASX: VXR) is pleased to announce it has
finalised preparations for a new exploration drilling programme at its 100%-owned Sulphur
Springs Copper-Zinc Project in WA, with drilling scheduled to commence in August.
The upcoming programme is designed to follow-up on the exceptional results generated from
2019 drilling at the advanced Breakers Prospect (see ASX release 4 September 2019), as well
as to test the Heli-borne Electromagnetic (HEM) target XA8, where previous drilling intersected
anomalous Ni-Cr mineralisation.

Breakers Prospect
Breakers is one of several advanced exploration targets identified within the highly prospective
Panorama Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) Trend, which hosts the Company’s flagship
Sulphur Springs Deposit (Indicated and Inferred Resources of 13.8Mt @ 1.5% Cu and 3.8% Zn;
(see Table 1 for details).
In 2019, Venturex completed the first significant exploration drilling program at Breakers in over
10 years, with exceptionally strong zinc-silver-lead grades returned.
Results from this drilling identified broad zones of VMS-style sulphide mineralisation across
approximately 1.0km of strike, returning several outstanding intercepts of high-grade zinc-silverlead mineralisation, including:
•

18m @ 7.75% Zn, 2.03% Pb, 0.25% Cu and 22.8g/t Ag from 155.0m in BKR005 (see
ASX release 17 June 2019); and

•

8m @ 3.37% Zn, 0.29% Pb, and 6.45g/t Ag from 84m in BKR007, including:
o An exceptional high-grade interval of 1m @ 20.9% Zn, 1.84% Pb and 34.7g/t Ag
from 85.0m (see ASX release 17 June 2019)

Base metal mineralisation at the prospect is broadly divided into two main target areas,
‘Breakers Main Gossan’ and ‘Breaker North’, with these separated by an interpreted horstgraben structure (Figure 2).
The programme is designed to systematically test extensions to the Breakers Main anomaly,
along with testing the along strike extension to zinc-rich mineralisation intersected at Breaker
North.
Previous drilling beneath the Breakers Main Gossan where rock chips samples record up to
36.7% Cu and 36% Zn (see ASX release 1 May 2019), has successfully identified several zones
of zinc-rich massive sulphide mineralisation, including the thick, high-grade intersection within
BRK005 (18m @ 7.75% Zn).
Geological modelling at the target, supported by down-hole electromagnetic (DHEM) data has
identified the potential for a steeply plunging mineral system(s). The modelled mineralisation is
interpreted to be controlled by several graben/horst-forming growth faults, importantly, the
along-strike and down-plunge continuation of these structures remains open in all directions.

An additional two holes will also be completed to test the along-strike and down-plunge
continuation of the zinc-rich mineralisation intersected at the Breakers North target, located
approximately 1.1km NNE of the Breakers Main anomaly.
Mineralisation at the Breaker North Target is also interpreted to be potentially bifurcated due to
the presence of horst-graben architecture, which suggests that multiple target horizons may be
present.

XA8 Prospect

For personal use only

The XA8 Prospect was initially identified by the 2017 HEM Excite Survey (see ASX release 27
November 2017).
First-pass exploration drilling completed at the prospect in 2018-2019 (SSD106 & SSR009)
targeting a ‘blind’ EM plate intersected strongly oxidised, Ni-Cr+/-Co mineralisation with assay
results including 17m @ 0.66% Cr and 0.33% Ni within SSR009 (see ASX releases 27
November 2017, 13 August 2018 & 26 June 2019).
The strongly anomalous Ni-Cr+/-Co mineral assemblage is hosted within a favourable
mafic/ultramafic intrusive unit that is interpreted to be highly prospective to host nickel-sulphide
style mineralisation. The polymetallic mineralisation identified at the XA8 prospect further
highlights the exceptional prospective potential within the Panorama Trend, for both VMS and
other mineral system types.
Two RC drill-holes are proposed to test the down-plunge and along strike continuation of a
DHEM target and mineralisation intersected within SSR009 and SSD106 at depth below the
base of oxidation.

Sulphur Springs Development
Venturex Executive Director, Mr Anthony Reilly, said the Company was looking forward to
getting back into the field to commence the 2020 exploration field season and follow-up on the
successful 2019 drilling results from the Breakers prospect – which indicated the potential for
an emerging base metal discovery in close proximity to the Sulphur Springs deposit.

“Any new discoveries along the Panorama Trend will strengthen our growth pipeline and
potentially either extend the life or increase the scale of a future base metal processing centre
at Sulphur Springs, so we are really looking forward to what this next phase of exploration can
deliver,” Mr Reilly said.
“We also plan to test several large EM targets highlighted in the 2017 HEM survey over the
northern portion of the Panorama Trend. The first target, XA8, shows potential early-stage
indications of nickel sulphide mineralisation quite distinct to the Sulphur Springs Cu-Zn orebody,
1,200m to the east.
“In parallel and following the recent EPA approval (ASX release 21 May 2020), we continue to
advance the secondary approvals for the Sulphur Springs Project”.
Share Purchase Plan

About Venturex Resources Limited
Venturex Resources Limited (ASX: VXR) is an exploration and development company with two advanced copper-zinc projects near Port
Hedland in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The two projects are the Sulphur Springs Project which includes the Sulphur Springs and
Kangaroos Caves deposits, plus 27km of prospective tenements on the Panorama trend; and the Whim Creek Project, which includes the
Resources at the Whim Creek, Mons Cupri and Salt Creek mines together with the Evelyn project and 18,100 ha of prospective tenements
over the Whim Creek basin. The Company’s focus is to finance its flagship Sulphur Springs Project, paving the way for its transformation
into a new mid-tier ASX-listed base metal producer in the medium term. This will position it to be a long-term supplier of copper and zinc to
global markets at a time when significant shortfalls are expected for both metals, especially copper.
