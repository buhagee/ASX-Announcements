Commentary

Raiz Invest CEO George Lucas says: “The June numbers are very encouraging as they were
achieved during an economic slowdown, ensuring we end another strong financial year on a high
note.

“The relatively modest increase in superannuation FUM during the month was achieved despite more
than $1 million in withdrawals due to COVID-19 Early Release, and the issues associated with
SuperMatch.

“In the quarter to 30 June 2020, we saw record net inflows of $63.4 million across the whole platform.
This demonstrates that our customers, many of whom are Millennials, recognise the value of the Raiz
Invest platform to support them in their savings and investing goals.
“The 15.1% growth in active customers and 30.6% growth in total FUM during the past 12 months
illustrates the leverage in FUM growth to customer growth in our business model. These increases
were achieved despite a greater than 10% fall in the S&P/ASX 200 during the period. We have broken
down some information on the portfolio demographic below.

“During the month we also soft launched Raiz in Malaysia that has more than 8,000 sign-ups as we
continue to work through the list of pre-registered users.”
