Mackay Potash Project – Western Australia (100% owned)
The Mackay Potash Project is situated on Lake Mackay and located 785km south of the Wyndham, Western
Australia (Figure 1). It comprises nine granted Exploration Licences covering an area of 3,057km2 in Western
Australia and three Exploration Licence applications covering an area of 1,240km2 in the Northern Territory.

Lake Mackay’s hydrogeological setting and favourable brine chemistry provide important attributes that support
the development of a globally significant sulphate of potash (“SOP”) operation. Lake Mackay is the largest
known potash-bearing salt lake in Australia covering an area of approximately 3,500km2. The salt lake is
comparable in size to the two major sources of primary SOP production, being the 4,400km2 Great Salt Lake in
the USA and the 5,500km2 Lop Nur (Luobupo operation) in China.
Figure 1. Project Location Map

The closest community to the project is Kiwirrkurra which is located approximately 60km south-west. A Native
Title Agreement is in place and provides the necessary consents for the project’s development and operations.
The Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the Mackay Potash Project was completed in May 2018. The PFS was based
on shallow trench extraction and solar evaporation of brine-hosted potash to produce 426,000tpa of SOP with
production to be shipped through the Company’s Wyndham Port Facility.
Details of the PFS results were provided in the Company’s ASX Release on 7 May 2018.
Over the past two years, the Company has been fully focussed on producing a high-quality and bankable
Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) and as part of that process an updated Mineral Resource estimate for the

project was reported in January 20201. This was the culmination of several years of data collection, including
long-term data acquired from the Company’s industry-leading trench pump testing program carried out across
Lake Mackay between August 2017 and July 2019.
The drainable porosity (or specific yield) Mineral Resource contains 123 million tonnes (“Mt”) of SOP to a
maximum depth of 211m. This drainable porosity Mineral Resource represents the static free-draining portion
of the total porosity Mineral Resource prior to extraction. It does not take into account any groundwater
recharge which could increase the amount of extractable brine over the life of an operation.
The total porosity Mineral Resource contains 1,096Mt of SOP to a maximum depth of 211m. A portion of the
total porosity Mineral Resource, in addition to the drainable porosity Mineral Resource, may be extractable
depending on the transient groundwater flow and transport conditions affecting the brine resource during
extraction and the active recharge regime within the lake system. Groundwater recharge by rainfall and runoff,
and associated flow and transport processes, have been assessed as a component of the dynamic
hydrogeological modelling and will be used to determine the Ore Reserve.

Definitive Feasibility Study – Progress During the Quarter
The Company continued to progress the DFS for the Mackay Potash Project throughout the quarter with the
focus being of the final areas of capital costs, financial modelling, final reviews and reporting. The study is close
to completion and the results are expected to be reported in July 2020.
During the quarter, the pilot pond operations on Lake Mackay were completed. This long-term evaporation trial
was operated from October 2018 to June 2020 and involved a 3,000m² pond system that was run as a constant
flow operation with brines being transferred through the ponds under a daily transfer regime. This industryleading trial has captured over a full annual cycle of operating data and has successfully validated the DFS pond
model and process assumptions, a major de-risking milestone for the project.
This trial also included the production and harvesting of more than 50 tonnes of raw potash salt at grades up to
12% K₂O. The potash salts have undergone pilot processing tests to produce larger quantities of SOP samples
within the Company’s targeted product specifications.

underpinning the Mineral Resource estimate continue to apply and have not materially changed.

Project Permitting
During the quarter, the Company continued to progress the project’s environmental impact assessment which
is underway with the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority and Commonwealth Department
of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. In May 2020, the Australian Federal Government awarded Major
Project Status to the Mackay Potash Project which will allow the government to provide additional assistance
with respect to the facilitation of Federal government approvals for the project.
During the quarter, the Company’s planned native title negotiation meetings in relation to the project’s haul
road remained on hold due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Negotiations with the Ngururrpa and the Tjurabalan
native title holders are planned to re-commence once community access and business meetings return to
normal.
Project Financing
Project funding and off-take for the Mackay Potash Project has attracted significant interest from some of the
world’s largest fertiliser companies. The imminent completion of the DFS is a major milestone for the finalisation
of project funding and off-take. During the quarter, the Company’s product samples continued to be distributed
to potential customers and strategic partners, with confirmation that Agrimin’s product specifications exceed
most existing products in the market.
In addition to discussions with potential strategic partners and traditional financiers, the Northern Australia
Infrastructure Facility (“NAIF”) Board has previously expressed its interest in investigating the potential for NAIF
support for the project with particular reference to Agrimin’s proposed infrastructure. The NAIF could
potentially provide concessional longer term debt finance for the project.

Lake Auld Potash Project – Western Australia (100% owned)
The Lake Auld Potash Project is located approximately 640km south-east of Port Hedland, Western Australia
(Figure 2). The project consists of a granted Exploration Licence covering a lakebed area of 108km² across Lake
Auld. Lake Auld’s exceptionally high grades, favourable climatic conditions for solar evaporation and proximity
to a major operating port support the potential for strong project economics.
The Lake Auld Potash Project is neighboured either side by the Company’s existing Exploration Licence
applications which cover the Canning Palaeovalley, including Lake Auld and Percival Lakes. The Company’s
tenements cover the most prospective portion of 450km long lake system where historic sampling of brine has
returned the highest known in-situ SOP grades from an Australian salt lake.
During the quarter, the Company’s planned native title consultations with the Martu native title holders
remained on hold due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Consultations are intended to commence once
community access is permitted.
A Concept Study for the Lake Auld Potash Project is currently underway for a boutique operation to produce
high-purity water-soluble SOP product for shipment via Port Hedland.

Corporate Activities
Share Issues
During the quarter, the Company issued 9,822,006 fully paid ordinary shares in relation to an entitlement offer
which raised $2.9 million. The Company also issued 250,000 fully paid ordinary shares (subject to a six month
voluntary escrow period) to Zinfandel Exploration Pty Ltd during the quarter as part of the consideration to
acquire the Lake Auld Potash Project. No other ordinary shares or other securities were issued during the
quarter.
Business Development
