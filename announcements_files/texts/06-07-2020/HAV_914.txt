GOLD IN FRACTURED ZONES AT KALKAROO
HIGHLIGHTS

•

Previous drilling results, including 82 metres of 1.14 g/t gold, highlight the prospectivity for
fracture-controlled saprolite gold mineralisation near the intersection of two major faults at
Kalkaroo.

•

A recent follow up drillhole returned 16 metres of 2.04 g/t gold in quartz-veined saprolite adjacent
to a north-northeast trending fault.

•

The demonstrated potential for widespread fracture vein and breccia style copper-gold
mineralisation will be the target of further follow up exploration drilling in this area.

Havilah Resources Limited (Havilah or Company) reports that the drilling program within the confines of a
conceptual starter open pit at West Kalkaroo has largely achieved its objectives, with only a few infill holes
remaining to be drilled to complete the program. Attention is turning to new gold exploration leads in areas
further to the east, especially outside of the current JORC Mineral Resource. A favoured area is near the
intersection of two major faults, which are thought to have formed part of the structural architecture that
focused the Kalkaroo copper-gold mineralisation (Figures 1 and 2).

Analysis of earlier drillholes in this area in Vulcan 3D software identified long gold runs in deeply weathered
bedrock (termed ‘saprolite’) that lies above the main copper-gold mineralised prospective horizon, as also
observed at West Kalkaroo. For example, Havilah reverse circulation drillhole KKRC0047 dating from 2004
returned an intersection of 82 metres of 1.14 g/t gold (and 26 metres of 1.08% copper) in quartz-veined host
rocks adjacent to a north-northeast trending fault. Fifty metres to the south, near the same fault, Newcrest
Mining Limited (Newcrest) aircore drillhole NKAC0171 drilled during June 1997 intersected 45 metres of 0.9
g/t gold (and 6 metres of 2% copper) in similar veined and brecciated host rocks (Figure 2).

These drilling results, and the proximity of known mineralised faults, indicates high discovery potential for
fracture vein and breccia style copper-gold mineralisation in this area (see Figures 1 and 2). As an initial test,
Havilah drilled two new aircore drillholes that were sited approximately 15 metres either side of KKRC0047
with favourable results as reported below:

KKAC0542: 8 metres of 1.0 g/t gold from 99-107 metres (15 metres south of KKRC0047).
KKAC0543: 16 metres of 2.04 g/t gold from 105-121 metres (15 metres north of KKRC0047).
KKRC0047: 82 metres of 1.14 g/t gold from 72-154 metres,
that included 34 metres of 2.02 g/t gold from 92-126 metres and
26 metres of 1.08% copper from 115-141 metres (2004 Havilah reverse circulation drillhole).
NKAC0171: 45 metres of 0.90 g/t gold from 90-135 metres and 6 metres of 2% copper from 123-129 metres
(June 1997 Newcrest aircore drillhole lying 50 metres south of KKRC0047 and ended in gold mineralisation).

Quartz veining, which is normally associated with faulting in this area, was logged in both holes. Drillhole
KKAC0543 returned an intersection of 16 metres of 2.04 g/t gold and ended in mineralisation at bit refusal. It
is planned to carry out additional follow up drilling to determine the extent of this style of fracture-controlled
gold mineralisation, which in general is of higher grade than the more typical Kalkaroo stratabound
replacement style copper-gold mineralisation, based on drilling results from West Kalkaroo.

Commenting on the drilling results Havilah’s Technical Director, Dr Chris Giles, said:

For personal use only

“The logging and assays suggest that the saprolite gold mineralisation here is largely related to fracturing and
quartz veining of the host rocks caused by the crushing effect near the intersection of two major faults.
“We think this fault intersection area has excellent potential for discovery of a new fracture vein and breccia
copper-gold mineralised zone and we will be testing this with additional drilling over coming weeks.

“In the meantime our Senior Mine Planning Engineer, Mr Richard Buckley, continues to work on the optimum
design for the gold-only start up open pit and our other Adelaide-based technical staff are preparing additional
documentation for mining approvals,” he said.

Figure 1 Target fault intersection zone (within red dashed area) at the intersection of a north-northeast
trending fault (green) and the east-northeast trending Kalkaroo fault (red). This area is considered to be
prospective for higher grade fracture vein and breccia style copper-gold mineralisation (see Figure 3). Havilah
aircore holes drilled during 2020 within the conceptual gold-only start up open pit (pink) are shown.

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry
standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc).
These examples should not be taken as limiting
the broad meaning of sampling.

•

Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.

•

Aspects of the determination of mineralisation
that are Material to the Public Report. In cases
where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this
would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation
drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from
which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more
explanation may be required, such as where there
is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation
types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant
disclosure of detailed information.

•

Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole
hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic,
etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or
standard tube, depth of diamond tails, facesampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).

•

Sample data was derived from Havilah aircore
(‘AC’) drillholes as documented in the table
above.
AC assay samples averaging 2-3kg were riffle
split at 1 metre intervals.
All AC drill samples were collected into prenumbered calico bags and packed into
polyweave bags by Havilah staff for shipment
to the assay lab in Adelaide.

All AC holes were drilled using a 121mm
blade bit. All samples were collected via riffle
splitting directly from the cyclone.

Overall, AC sample recoveries were considered
to be quite acceptable for interpretation and
modelling purposes.
The sample yield and wetness of the AC
samples was routinely recorded in drill logs.
Very few samples were too wet to split. No
evidence of sample bias due to preferential
concentration of fine or coarse material was
observed.
Sample
recoveries
were
continuously
monitored by the geologist on site and
adjustments to drilling methodology were
made to optimise sample recovery and quality
where necessary.
All AC samples were logged by an
experienced geologist directly into a digital
logging system with data uploaded directly
into an Excel spreadsheet and transferred to
a laptop computer.
All AC chip sample trays and some back-up
samples are stored on site at Kalkaroo.
Logging is semi-quantitative and 100% of
reported intersections have been logged.
Logging is of a sufficiently high standard to
support any subsequent interpretations,
resource estimations and mining and
metallurgical studies.
AC drill chips were received directly from the
drilling rig via a cyclone and were riffle split
on 1 metre intervals to obtain 2-3 kg samples.
Sampling size is considered to be appropriate
for the style of mineralisation observed. Assay
repeatability for gold and other metals has
not proven to be an issue in the past and is
checked with regular duplicates.
All Havilah samples were collected in
numbered calico bags that were sent to ALS
assay lab in Adelaide.
At ALS assay lab the samples are crushed in a
jaw crusher to a nominal 6mm (method CRU21) from which a 3kg split is obtained using a
riffle splitter. The split is pulverized in an LM5
to 85% passing 75 microns (method PUL-23).
These pulps are stored in paper bags.
All samples were analysed for gold by 50g fire
assay, with AAS finish using ALS method AuAA26.
All sample pulps are retained by Havilah and
other elements (such as copper and rare-earth
elements) will be assayed using these pulps as
required in the future.

Fire assay method Au-AA26 is a total gold
analysis.
Assay data accuracy and precision was
continuously checked through submission of
field and laboratory standards, blanks and
repeats which were inserted at a nominal rate
of approximately 1 per 25 drill samples.
Assay data for laboratory standards and
repeats for Kalkaroo were previously
statistically analysed and no material issues
were noted.

Checking of the new Au assays against Au
assays from adjacent earlier drillholes
indicated good overall correlation.
Rigorous internal QC procedures are followed
to check all assay results.
All data entry is under control of the
responsible geologist, who is responsible for
data management, storage and security.

The holes were surveyed using an electronic
downhole camera in a stainless steel rod and
inner tube.
Present drillhole collar coordinates were
surveyed in UTM coordinates using a
differential GPS system with an x:y:z accuracy
of 20cm:20cm:40cm and are quoted in AGD66
Zone 54 datum.
The two exploratory aircore holes reported
here were drilled either side of a previous
Havilah drillhole (KKRC0047) that had a
significant gold intersection. Both were drilled
in a similar orientation to the original hole with
the objective of determining the geometry,
direction and controls on mineralisation in this
area.
Sample compositing was not used.
The drillhole azimuth and dip was chosen to
intersect the mineralised zones as nearly as
possible to right angles and at the desired
positions to maximise the value of the drilling
data.
At this stage, no material sampling bias is
known to have been introduced by the drilling
direction.
AC chip samples are directly collected from
the riffle splitter in numbered calico bags.

Several calico bags are placed in each
polyweave bag which are then sealed with
cable ties. The samples are transported to the
assay lab by Havilah personnel at the end of
each field stint.
There is minimal opportunity for systematic
tampering with the samples as they are not
out of the control of Havilah personnel until
they are delivered to the assay lab.
This is considered to be a secure and
reasonable procedure and no known
instances of tampering with samples
occurred during the drilling programs.
Ongoing internal auditing of sampling
techniques and assay data has not revealed
any material issues.
Robert Dennis who was formerly employed
by consulting firm RPM Global Asia Limited

degree dipping northern nose of the Kalkaroo
south dome. It is hosted by an 80m-120m
thick mineralised horizon that is sandwiched
between psammitic footwall rocks and a thick
pelitic hangingwall sequence.
In part, the mineralisation is associated with
near-vertical, mineralised quartz vein breccia
fracture/fault fillings, which probably formed
channel ways for the mineralising fluids.
Interference folding resulted in dome
structures which probably acted as structural
traps for the rising mineralising fluids carried
by these vertical structures.
The mineralising events were associated with
iron-rich and sodium-rich alteration fronts,
which are manifest as widespread finegrained magnetite in the lower sandy
formations and as pervasive albite alteration,
overprinted by later potassic veining and
alteration.
Erosion in the Mesozoic and Tertiary period
exposed the region to prolonged and deep
weathering. Consequently, the original
sulphide
mineralisation
shows
typical
supergene enrichment features in its upper
part, caused by oxidation of the primary
sulphides in the weathering zone, forming a
soft clay rich rock called saprolite. This is
manifest in a sub-horizontal stratification of
the ore minerals from top to bottom:
1. Supergene free gold in saprolite, with
generally minor copper, recoverable by
gravity and cyanide leaching methods.
2. Native copper and gold in saprolite,
largely recoverable by gravity methods.
3. Chalcocite dominant with gold,
recoverable by conventional flotation.
4. Chalcopyrite dominant with gold and
locally rich molybdenum, recoverable by
conventional flotation.
