Mt Cecelia Fieldwork to Kick-off
and Access Agreement Reached
o First field trip scheduled in July to determine access and perform initial mapping of the
Gold, VMS and Manganese targets1
o Mt Cecelia located in the highly prospective East Pilbara and Paterson Province region
o Agreement reached with FNA proponent to access the entire Mt Cecelia’s Exploration
License area (224km2)
o RIO Tinto’s (ASX:RIO) scheduled drilling at the Carawine (ASX:CWX) JV Baton project in
Q2 20202, adjacent WWI’s Mt Cecelia project border, highlights the areas prospectivity
***
Jac van Heerden, Managing Director commented: “The team is excited to be advancing exploration
at the Mt Cecelia project in the East Pilbara WA with the first field trip scheduled for mid-July. The
access agreement will enable reconnaissance of the entire project area with a focus on the gold, VMS
and manganese targets identified in the recent PGN Geoscience desktop review.
Mt Cecelia sits in Australia’s most highly anticipated exploration region following RIO’s WINU and
Greatland Gold’s Havieron discoveries in the Paterson Province, the Company has been actively
following the hive of exploration activity in the region and looks forward to having boots on the
ground to take the project forward.”

West Wits Mining (ASX: WWI, ‘West Wits’ or ‘the Company’), is pleased to announce the first stage
of field exploration at the Company’s Mt Cecelia Project in the East Pilbara / Paterson Province will
commence in July and that agreement has been reached with the proponent of the renewable
energy project to access the entire 224km2 exploration license footprint in this highly prospective
region.
Mt Cecelia Exploration Field Trip
The tenement area is approximately 200km ENE of Marble Bar, the initial field trip will determine
accessibility to the tenement area with a focus on the Gold, VMS and Manganese targets identified in
PGN Geoscience expert desktop study.
The new geological interpretation resolved a new architecture and consequently new litho-structural
framework for the Mt Cecelia project area within E45/5045, the central west area location is highly
prospective for orogenic banded-iron formations (“BIF”) hosted gold (Figure 1).

The study reported that the Kylena Formation and Jeerinah Formation are prospective for VMS
deposits, both of which occur in significant volumes within the tenement area. These formations
represent classic bimodal volcanic sequences and as such, present a significant opportunity and
considerable spatial extent for exploration within the WWI tenure1.

Figure 1: (left) E45/5045 tenement and geology and (right) target area highlighted.
In addition to the BIF and VMS targets there is also upside potential for one or more manganese
deposits1.
The exploration team will perform a first pass field work inspection to document the outcropping and
other features in the main areas of interest to confirm the presence of the targeted bodies (eg. BIF,
jaspilite, ferruginous chert, black shales, etc.) identified in the PGN Geoscience desktop study.
The field trip will also identify locations to setup remote exploration base camps and supply points to
support a larger team for the duration of future exploration programs.

Regional Activity – East Pilbara and Paterson Province
WWI’s Mt Cecelia project is located approximately 150km ENE of Marble Bar, 150km NW of Telfer
Mine, and 120km NNW of Nifty mine (aerial distance). The region is considered one of the country’s
most prominent addresses for mineral exploration with several joint venture agreements being
reached since RIO’s WINU discovery, approximately 70km east of Mt Cecelia, and AIM Listed
Greatland Gold’s Haverion project east of Telfer (Figure 2).
RIO’s extensive 2018 pegging campaign included EL’s covering over 60% of Mt Cecelia’s border with
its local interest increased through the $6m farm-in & joint venture agreement with Carawine
Resources (ASX:CWX) to explore CWX’s Baton project3 which sits on Mt Cecelia’s SE boundary.
Drilling of the Baton targets by RIO was scheduled to commence in Q2 20202.
The Company signed an access deed with RIO in October 2019 allowing RIO to build tracks on the Mt
Cecelia tenement area to access their surrounding tenements and was notified of airborne gravity
surveys performed by RIO in 4Q2019, which flew over our Mt Cecelia ground, highlighting the
proximity to regional exploration and the project’s prospectivity.

Province & East Pilbara region
Mid-tier miner, IGO Limited (ASX:IGO), has also demonstrated strong interest in the region having
completed a $15m earn-in agreement with Encounter Resources (ASX:ENR) at ENR’s Yeneena project
with soil sampling and geophysical survey’s commencing in June/July 20204. IGO’s interest extends
via the execution of a $32m Joint Venture term sheet in June 2020 with Metals X (ASX:MTX) at
MTX’s Paterson Exploration Project (PEP) but excludes the historically significant Nifty mine (Figure
2)5. Both Yeneena, PEP and Nifty are located to the south of WWI’s Mt Cecelia project along the
Vines Fault (Figure 2) which was a focus of the PGN desktop review and the upcoming field work.
Access Agreement finalised
An access agreement has been finalised with the proponent of FNA 13553 and 14592 which provides
WWI access to the entire 224km2 tenement area for exploration, meeting the Department of Mines,
Industry Regulation and Safety (“DMIRS”) condition when granting EL 45/5045:
“No access to the areas designated FNA 13553 or FNA 14592 as displayed in TENGRAPH, prior to the
holder entering into an access agreement with the proponents of the proposed Solar and Wind Farm
Project”6
The overlapping area covers approximately 11% (25km2) of the EL’s 70 blocks 22,423.72 Ha (224km2)
in the East Pilbara (Figure 3). The overlapping area sits outside of the three exploration target areas
identified in the desktop study and therefore did not have an immediate impact on the current field
trip. However, the northern area is subject to continuing assessment by the exploration team with

the new interpretation of the Vines Fault projecting through the NW portion of the tenement which
has had little historical exploration and provides further opportunity.
