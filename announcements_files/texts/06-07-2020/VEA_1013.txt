Chairman address
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Viva Energy’s 2020 Annual General Meeting. I am
Robert Hill and I am honoured to serve as the Chairman of Viva Energy.

For personal use only

It is now just after 11 am Australian Eastern Standard Time. We have a quorum present and I declare
this Annual General Meeting of Viva Energy Group Limited open.
Thank you for joining us today from various locations across the country and the rest of the world. We
are holding our annual general meeting today as a virtual meeting conducted entirely online. We are also
holding this meeting later in the year than we ordinarily would. We made a decision to hold the event in
this way due to the restrictions on gatherings and travel as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. We consider
that it is in the best interests of our shareholders, people and the community for us to do so.
We are disappointed that we cannot meet with you in person and we look forward to being able to do so
next year.
I would like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of country throughout Australia and I
pay my respects to their Elders past and present.
Viva Energy has long supported programs which connect our employees and business activities with
indigenous communities throughout the country. Last year, this indigenous participation program was
formalised in our inaugural reconciliation action plan which was endorsed by Reconciliation Australia.
This plan celebrates Indigenous cultures, promotes reconciliation, builds respect and raises cultural
awareness. The treatment of indigenous cultures has attracted much attention in recent times, and we
remain committed to encouraging a more accepting, understanding and inclusive society in the future.
Before we begin, I will take a few minutes to run through some procedural matters.
If we experience technical issues today that result in a number of members being unable to reasonably
participate, the meeting will be adjourned and we will re-convene at 3.00pm Australian Eastern Standard
Time today. If the technical issues are isolated to my Adelaide location, then I nominate Jane McAloon,
who is present at the Melbourne office to assume the Chair and adjourn the meeting.
In the event that we take steps to adjourn the meeting, we will make an announcement to the ASX with
all the necessary details.
Voting on all items of business today will be carried out by way of a poll.
Shareholders had the option of casting their vote before the meeting or appointing a proxy to do so on
their behalf. If you haven’t done so, you can vote at today’s meeting online. You can do so at any time
during the meeting starting from now as the polls are now open for voting.
Voting will close shortly after the end of the meeting.
We received some questions in the lead up to the AGM. We will address these during the formal items of
business.
If you would like to ask a question live at today’s meeting, you can do so by typing and submitting your
question online. You do not need to wait until we get to the formal items of business to submit your
questions. There may be a slight delay in transmission of up to 20 seconds so I encourage you to start
submitting your questions now and we will address these a little later today.
As I mentioned earlier, I am coming to you today from Adelaide.
Joining us from our Melbourne office are two of your directors:



Scott Wyatt, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director; and
Jane McAloon, an independent Non-executive Director and Chair of our Sustainability Committee.

You will hear from both Scott and Jane today.
Joining us from Sunshine Coast is Sarah Ryan, Independent Non-Executive Director, and Chair of our
Audit and Risk Committee. Sarah joins us by telephone today.
1

And we have joining us from Singapore three of our Singapore based directors:




Arnoud De Meyer, Independent Non-Executive Director, and Chair of the Investment Committee;
Hui Meng Kho, Non-executive Director. Hui Meng is the President and CEO of Vitol Asia; and
Dat Duong, Non-Executive Director. Dat is Head of Investments at Vitol in Asia Pacific.

For personal use only

Jevan Bouzo, our Chief Financial Officer, and Julia Kagan, our Company Secretary, join us from our
Melbourne office today.
And joining us by telephone are Chris Dodd, Lead Engagement Partner, and Niamh Hussey, Partner,
representing our auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Chris and Niamh will be available to answer
questions on the auditor’s report later in the meeting.
I will now move on to my remarks on the business.
There is no doubt that we are living through a remarkable set of circumstances which are challenging us
all.
Over the last summer, our country experienced some of the most devastating bushfires we have seen,
with loss of life and widespread damage to our communities and the economy. During that time, our
people worked tirelessly to support fuel deliveries into impacted areas, supported the defence response
and provided direct support to our customers that experienced difficulties as a result of the disaster. We
also supported two regional charities in their work to assist famers and rebuild affected communities.
Many of our rural customers were directly impacted by the fires and we consider this is an area where
we could help contribute to the rebuilding effort.
Since that time, the emergence and escalation of Covid-19 to a global pandemic has brought a different
set of challenges to all of our communities. It remains an unpredictable and unprecedented event in
modern times and the far-reaching impacts of the crisis have yet to be fully understood.
As the crisis unfolded, your executive team, led by Scott, has worked closely with the Board to identify
the key risks to people and our business. We took appropriate steps to navigate through the disruption
and ensure we maintain supply of essential services to our customers and the broader community. The
Board commends the efforts of our people.
Our immediate focus as the Covid-19 crisis unfolded was the health and safety of our people. We quickly
took steps to implement measures to maintain workplace distancing in our operational facilities, and
have had more than half of our twelve hundred employees working productively from home. Our refining
and supply chain facilities continued to operate safely and reliably throughout this time, and we have
successfully kept Covid-19 from our workplaces.
As you would expect, the restrictions put in place by governments to manage the spread of Covid-19
significantly impacted demand for fuel. Sales of Jet fuel fell by 73% as international and domestic border
restrictions were put in place, and sales in our retail Alliance business declined by between 30% to 40%
at the height of the crisis in April. While the aviation sector remains heavily impacted, retail sales have
begun to recover as restrictions have been relaxed and domestic flight schedules are beginning to
return.
As a result of this lower demand, we took appropriate steps to reduce production at our refinery in
Victoria and shut down a number of surplus processing units at the end of April. Despite challenging
refining conditions, we have maintained refining operations in order to provide continued fuel supply to
our customers and maintain continuous employment for our employees and contractors. We believe this
is also the best financial outcome for the Company.
I am also particularly pleased with the way the Company has taken steps to reduce operating cost and
capital expenditure without impacting our safety and integrity programs. This has helped preserve cash,
and Scott will talk further about the decisions we have announced regarding our major maintenance
turnaround at Geelong when he addresses you later.
I will turn now turn to our achievements and performance in 2019.
Last year we took important steps to consolidate our key strategic relationships and reposition the
business for future growth. The renegotiation and extension of our long-term partnership with Coles was
a particularly important step to strengthening our fuels and convenience business. I am pleased with the
progress we have since made to restore sales growth and begin to recover our leadership position. We

2

have also extended our license of the Shell brand until 2029, continuing our long association with one of
the world’s most recognisable brands.

For personal use only

In late 2019, we acquired the remaining share of the Liberty Wholesale business and established a new
joint venture with our long-term partners which will expand our regional network of Liberty branded fuel
and convenience stores. We currently have just under 60 Liberty branded stores in operation and we are
excited about the potential for this network to help us reach a new segment of customers.
We believe that the Retail business will continue to evolve over the next decade as new energies are
adopted and the convenience needs of customers becomes more important. With the changes made in
2019, our Coles Express, Liberty and Owner Operator retail platforms are now well placed to succeed in
this changing landscape.
In our commercial businesses, we have continued to strengthen our relationships with major customers
and expand operations with key partners such as Rio Tinto and the Australian Defence Force. We have
a diverse range of commercial businesses and a proud history of servicing many of Australia’s largest
companies. We thank all our customers for their continued support.
Despite a challenging refining margin environment, our refining operations performed extremely well,
with high levels of availability and record levels of production achieved during 2019. A new 25ML
gasoline tank was commissioned to address key infrastructure opportunities and we also successfully
developed a new Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil for use in the marine segment following the global transition
to new fuel standards.
Notwithstanding these achievements, the general business environment was particularly challenging
during 2019. Refining margins were impacted by changes in crude flows and lower regional demand
growth, and we experienced periods of intense competition which impacted both Retail and Commercial
margins. We saw improvements in market conditions towards the end of the year, but overall Group
Underlying EBITDA for financial year 2019 finished down 17% on the prior year at $644.5 million. This is
a disappointing result, but we remain confident in the changes we have made and the potential for the
business in the future.
Scott will talk to you in more detail about our performance in a little while.
Early this year, we took the strategic decision to divest our stake in Viva Energy REIT (now re-named
Waypoint REIT). Our investment in the REIT began with the decision in 2016 to divest our freehold
service station network and list the vehicle on the ASX. It has been a great journey and a significant
transaction from start to finish. We wish the best to the Waypoint management team, and expect to
continue our close relationship as their key tenant.
As we announced in February this year, we intend to return the proceeds of that REIT divestment to our
shareholders. The commencement of the buy-back program to return the proceeds was delayed by the
rapidly evolving Covid-19 crisis, but has subsequently commenced in June 2020 with an initial tranche of
the on-market buy-back targeting up to $50 million return. Our strong balance sheet and relatively strong
performance through the initial period of Covid-19 gives us confidence to begin returning the proceeds to
our shareholders, but we will continue to monitor this environment.
Turning to dividends now. The Board determined and paid a fully franked dividend of 2.6 cents per share
for the six months ended 31 December 2019, taking total dividend for the year to 4.7 cents per share.
This represents a dividend payout ratio at 60% of distributable net profit after tax, in-line with our target
payout ratio.
I would now like to talk about our Geelong Refinery and our vision for that part of the business. Although
Covid-19 has had a significant impact on global demand for oil products and regional refining margins,
we have made important changes to our operations and maintenance programs which we believe will
minimise the immediate and short-term impacts to earnings in this part of the business.
We are also encouraged by the commitment from federal and state governments to work with the
refining sector to maintain refining operations in Australia and continue to see Geelong playing an
important role in this regard.
Our refinery at Geelong produces more than 50% of Victoria’s liquid fuel requirements, and is the only
manufacturer of bitumen, hydrocarbon solvents and Avgas in Australia. We are well located in one of the
fastest growing states in the country and believe that we have an opportunity to play a broader role in
improving energy security and participating in the transition to a lower carbon energy future.

3

For personal use only

We announced in June 2020, our vision to develop an ‘Energy Hub’ at Geelong. This would potentially
see the development of an LNG regasification facility to increase the supply of natural gas to Victoria and
the construction of additional crude and fuel storage to support the government’s objective to establish a
national strategic oil reserve. These initiatives would help to reduce the operating costs of the refinery,
and provide a platform for other energy projects such as solar generation and battery storage, hydrogen
manufacture and gas-powered electricity generation.
Collectively, these projects can also support the transition to a lower carbon energy future and provide
potentially valuable new business opportunities for the Company.
Just before I hand over to Scott, I would like to say a few words on the changes to our Executive
Leadership Team. Last year, Megan Foster joined us to lead our Retail business and Amanda Fleming
joined the team as our Chief People and Technology Officer.
Daniel Ridgway left the Company at the end of May 2020, after more than 22 years with the business.
Dan is a high calibre executive and the Board extends their appreciation to Dan for his significant
contribution during his time with the Company, and in his senior executive role since the beginnings of
Viva Energy.
Thys Heyns, who has capably run the Geelong refinery for almost 6 years, has succeeded Dan in the
role of Chief Operating Officer. And most recently, we welcomed Dale Cooper who joined us from
Canada to replace Thys as the Refinery Manager.
These changes maintain a good balance of leadership continuity and refreshment, and the Board
welcomes these new executives to the company.
I will ask Scott now to take us through his presentation.

CEO address
Thank you Robert.

For personal use only

Before I speak to our financial performance I would like to talk about our commitment to safety and the
environment. Preventing harm to our people and the environment remains a fundamental priority for our
business and is the foremost consideration in everything that we do.
During 2019 we progressed several new programs to help us drive and sustain a strong safety culture
across our refining and supply chain operations. These have delivered an approximately 20% reduction
in our recordable injury rate from 2018 to 2019 and we continue to maintain a strong performance in
managing process safety risks across our operations. While these improvements are encouraging, we
are of course always striving to do better.
This year, we have maintained a strong health and safety performance despite the challenges presented
by Covid-19 and the bushfire and hurricane season prior to that. Periods of such significant change and
disruption can often have an impact on personal safety outcomes, so I am pleased that we are delivering
further improvements throughout this period and in May achieved zero recordable incidents across our
business. This is a remarkable achievement which goes to the commitment of our employees and
contractors to Goal Zero.
During this challenging time, we have also taken the opportunity to broaden our focus on mental health
and wellbeing in our workforce, improved our domestic and family violence policies, and generally
maintained high levels of leadership engagement and communication with all our employees.
I am very pleased with the way our people have adapted to our circumstances and continued to drive
strong safety and business results.
Turning now to our business performance which is presented on a replacement cost basis consistent
with our normal practise.
At a Group level, we delivered strong top line volume growth in 2019, with a total volume of 14.7 billion
litres, up 4.6% on 2018. Our Underlying EBITDA for the Group was $644.5 million which was lower than
2018 primarily as a result of weaker refining margins and periods of intense competition which impacted
retail and commercial margins.
In 2020, we estimate that the Underlying Group EBITDA for the first six months will be between $257.5 –
287.5 million. This is a particularly strong result in the current crisis which also compares favourably to
the first half of 2019.
In 2019, our Retail business delivered an Underlying EBITDA of $564.3 million.
As Robert mentioned earlier, our priority last year was restoring growth to the Alliance network following
the renegotiation of the Alliance Agreement with Coles Express. We improved the competitiveness of our
fuel offer, and invested in promotional and marketing campaigns to recover and gain new customers.
Sales subsequently climbed to an average of approximately 65 million litres per week in the second half
of 2019, up from 59.5 million litres per week in the first half.
This sales growth continued in the early part of this year, with several weeks above 70 million litres per
week, and sales for the first quarter 2020 up 5.1% over the same period last year. Retail margins have
also substantially improved since 2019. Of course the restrictions in place to manage the spread of
Covid-19 materially impacted sales from late March 2020, falling to below 40 million litres per week in
April, but since reverting to 45 million litres per week in May, and showing further improvement in June.
Our commercial business delivered an Underlying EBITDA of $296.5 million in 2019.
Despite periods of increased competition, we successfully renewed and extended many of our
commercial contracts and strengthened our relationships with key customers. Overall commercial sales
increased by 2% over 2018 and we maintained strong market positions in resources, aviation and marine
sectors in particular. The introduction of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil has ensured we maintain a
leadership position in the marine sector, and we are particularly proud to secure the services contract for
HMAS Cairns with the Australian Defence Force.

5

Covid-19 has obviously heavily impacted our sales to the Aviation sector this year, which are down
around 73%, but expected to slowly recover as domestic flights are increased in the second half of this
year. Other sectors remain relatively unaffected at this stage, and Diesel sales have been particularly
robust throughout this period.

For personal use only

In Refining, we delivered an Underlying EBITDA of $117.0 million in 2019.
The business achieved several operational records during the year, with white barrel production
averaging 105 thousand barrels per day, and refinery intake of 42 million barrels, each of which
represent significant production records for the business.
Regional refining margins were generally weak in 2019, due to lower regional demand growth and rising
crude premiums as the industry transitioned to lower sulphur marine fuels. The Geelong Refinery Margin
averaged US$6.6/barrel in 2019, down from US$7.4/barrel the year prior.
A weaker refining margin environment has continued in 2020 as a result of higher crude premiums
followed by the global impacts from Covid-19. In response to lower local demands, we slowed units and
shut down our cat cracking unit and smaller crude distillation unit at the end of April. As a consequence
monthly crude intake has been reduced to approximately 2.5m barrels.
This year we planned to complete the major maintenance of the Residual Catalytic Cracking Unit and the
Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit over 55 days from August through to October 2020. The original plan
would have resulted in over 700 additional contractors working on the site which would have made it
difficult to manage the Covid-19 risks and restrictions. After exploring several alternatives, it was
determined that the best option was to defer the maintenance of the Alkylation Unit, and undertake the
major maintenance of the RCCU over a longer period, commencing in July 2020.
This revised scope and timing has allowed us to further reduce capital spend this year and keep the
refinery operational to maximise future optionality. It also allowed us to significantly reduce the number
of additional contractors required, and to deploy a largely local workforce rather than rely on workers
from interstate. On this revised plan, all units will be available for operation by November this year.
As Robert mentioned earlier, together with the decision to approve the major maintenance expenditure,
we announced our vision and plans to establish Geelong as a significant Energy Hub. The Hub would
support the broader energy needs of Victoria and South-East Australia and create an exciting range of
opportunities for the business which also supports our commitment to contribute to lower carbon energy
future over time.
At the centre of the Energy Hub is a proposed LNG import terminal. This would provide a cost-effective
method to bring additional gas to the south east coast markets and meet an expected supply shortage
from 2023.
The Geelong Refinery is an existing industrial facility with excellent access to port and jetty infrastructure
to support a floating storage and regasification vessel. Given the nature of the project, there will be
limited additional infrastructure necessary, with close connection into the gas transmission network. It
also provides “behind the meter” supply which would benefit the refining operations.
Natural gas is a key transition fuel which can provide important base load power as coal generation
declines, as well as important firming capacity to support renewables as they come on-line. We have
made significant progress on the pre-FEED assessment of this project, and we have launched an initial
expression of interest process inviting potential partners to participate.
Geelong is also a natural location to support additional crude and product storage in response to the
Federal Government’s recent RFI to build and create strategic additional strategic oil reserves in
Australia. We have significant room for expansion not only at Geelong, but also across our infrastructure
and terminal network throughout Australia, and we consider that we can most efficiently address the
Government’s goals, while also supporting our existing operations.
Beyond the LNG project and strategic reserves, there are other opportunities for Geelong to participate
in the broader energy transition. Vacant land that forms the “buffer” to our refinery is an ideal location for
a solar farm which has enough capacity to meet a large proportion of the electricity needs of the Refinery
and potentially hydrogen production.

6

As we assess these opportunities, our focus will be working with our communities, and with key
regulatory bodies, to ensure that the development meets the wider requirements of society.

For personal use only

Let me finish by acknowledging the support of our employees. It has been a particularly challenging year,
but I am very proud of the way our people have responded and the results that they have delivered. We
have an engaged workforce which is committed to the success of our company and together with our
Board, I am confident that we can continue to perform well in the months ahead and emerge stronger as
the economy recovers.
We thank you for your continued support.
I will now hand over to Robert to take us through the formal business of the meeting.

The Chairman then conducted the formal items of business.
