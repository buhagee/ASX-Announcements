Dear Sir/Madam

Market update

Pinnacle Investment Management Group Limited (Pinnacle) is pleased to advise that five Affiliates
(Hyperion, Palisade, Coolabah, Metrics and Firetrail) have earned performance fees for the year ended 30
June 2020 (including only the part-year period during which it has been a Pinnacle Affiliate, in the case of
Coolabah) totalling approximately $25.8m at 100% gross, in aggregate.

The estimated impact of these performance fees on Pinnacle’s NPAT for the 2019-20 financial year is in the
order of positive $6.7m.

Pinnacle also advises that it expects the net return on Principal Investments for the 2019-20 financial year
(the sum of the two Pinnacle profit and loss statement items ‘Distributions and dividends’ and ‘Fair value
losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’) to have been in the order of negative $0.5m.
This amount is made up of ‘Distributions and dividends’ received of $0.8m for the full year and ‘Fair value
losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ of $1.3m for the full year. Together these items
comprised positive $0.4m in H1 and negative approximately $0.9m in H2.
It is emphasised that these numbers represent preliminary estimates, and are still subject to audit. Full year
audited financial results are scheduled to be released on Tuesday, 4 August 2020.
