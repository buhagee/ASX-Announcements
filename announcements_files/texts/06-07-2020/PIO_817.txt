Compelling gold targets identified at Golden Ridge
Field reconnaissance programs underway as ongoing gold prospectivity review of the Company’s
Projects reveals significant gold targets at Golden Ridge

HIGHLIGHTS
Þ Pioneer’s Golden Ridge Project is located 20km southeast of the world-class Kalgoorlie Superpit and 7km
along strike from the Boorara Gold Project being
developed by Horizon Minerals Limited (ASX: HRZ).

Þ The Project lies within the well-endowed MenziesBoorara Shear Zone (MBSZ) that hosts the New
Boddington, Paddington, Boorara and Golden Ridge
Deposits (the latter two are owned by Horizon Minerals
Limited – ASX:HRZ).

Boorara Gold Project

Þ Historical drilling intercepts1 at Pioneer’s Golden Ridge
Project include:
o 21 metres @ 2.5g/t Au from 59 metres (hole ID:
GOC0288 – Flying Ant Prospect); and
o 19 metres @ 2.21g/t Au from 51 metres (hole
ID: GOC0259 – Flying Ant Prospect); and
o 11 metres @ 4.18g/t Au from 3 metres (hole ID:
GOC0274 – Flying Squirrel Prospect).

Refer to Table 1 for more detailed information.

Þ The ongoing Gold Prospectivity Review has identified
other Company Projects with emerging gold potential
and information on these is expected to be released
during the September Quarter.

- Golden Ridge Gold Mine (2.5km
distance)
- Boorara Gold Project (9km distance).

Pioneer Resources Managing Director, Tim Spencer, said: “In recent years, the focus at our BlairGolden Ridge Project has been on nickel, however this has not always been the case – particularly for
previous holders of the ground, including WMC Resources.
“The thick historical gold intercepts outlined above were probably not as interesting for a company
looking for big deposits in a sub-A$600/oz gold price environment, but they are certainly interesting
with gold over A$2,500/oz.
“This ground has been intermittently explored and drilled for over 40 years so there is much work to
be done in pulling together and interpreting all the historical data as one dataset. We are encouraged
that compelling targets have been identified early in this work.”

Pioneer Resources Limited (ASX: PIO) (Pioneer or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has made
encouraging early progress with a recently commenced Gold Prospectivity Review of its key projects, with a
review of historical data identifying a number of exciting exploration targets at its 100%-owned Blair-Golden
Ridge Project near Kalgoorlie.

For personal use only

The targets will be further evaluated over the coming weeks with a view to finalising an exploration program
to be undertaken during the September Quarter.

GOLDEN RIDGE – REGIONAL SETTING AND GEOLOGY

Pioneer’s Golden Ridge Project lies within the highly prospective Menzies – Boorara Shear Zone (MBSZ) that
hosts six significant gold mines. At the north end of the MBSZ, the Paddington Gold Mine has produced over
3.5Moz in the past 20 years while the Golden Ridge Gold Mine is located towards the southern zone of the
MBSZ.
The north-west portion of the tenements represents the southern-most extension of the Golden Ridge trend
which hosts the Golden Ridge Gold Mine (reported historic production of 253,000 ounces at 10g/t) currently
held by Horizon Minerals Ltd. The gold mine is located on the eastern margin of the Boorara-Woolibar Fault
which continues south, through Pioneer’s Project. It is a north-trending, fault-bounded, corridor of fragmental
felsic volcanics inter-bedded between metasediments to the west and ultramafic rocks to the east.
Gold mineralisation has been identified within Pioneer’s Golden Ridge Project area and occurs along strike to
the south of the Golden Ridge Gold Mine. It is associated with two lines of historical workings at the 18 Footer
(600m strike length) and Flying Ant Prospects (400m strike length).
Mineralisation occurs within the Boorara Domain and is related to NNW trending, parallel shear zones up to
100m wide and is hosted by a complex stratigraphy including ultramafics, chloritic sediments, volcanogenic
sediments and foliated basalts.

The mineralisation is controlled by a stockwork of quartz veinlets characterised by pervasive sericite-sulphide
alteration showing strong similarities to other gold deposits within the MBSZ.

Additional gold prospects where significant gold mineralisation has been intersected in historical drilling are
Flying Squirrel, Duplex Hill and Gold Star located in the southeast of the project area adjacent to the Mount
Monger Fault.
No deep drilling has been conducted at any of the gold prospects and drilling has rarely tested below 100m
depth from surface with the average hole depth being 80 metres.

Background

For personal use only

Most of the land package that makes up the Golden Ridge Project was put together by WMC Resources Ltd in
the early 1980s. The initial work covered both gold and nickel but, given the presence of the Blair Nickel
Deposit (Figure 4) which was discovered in the late 1960s and developed in 1989, much of the exploration
focus was on nickel.
Figure 3 – An aerial image
with the Project tenement
boundaries outlined.
Tenement M26/222,
highlighted in yellow,
contains the Flying Ant
and 18 Footer Prospects.
The Blair Nickel Mine is
circled.

The tenements comprising the core of the Golden Ridge Project were sold to Gold Fields Ltd in 2002, which
in turn sold them onto Australian Mines Limited (ASX: AUZ) in 2003. In 2006, Pioneer entered into a nickel
joint venture with Australian Mines, with the latter keeping the gold rights notwithstanding their focus on restarting the Blair Nickel Mine.
In 2012, Pioneer acquired 100% of the Project including the gold rights. Based on work completed by Pioneer
and previous operators, five advanced gold prospects have been identified with significant drilling
intersections of >1g/t Au (refer Table 1) within the Golden Ridge Project.

Gold was intersected by Pioneer at the Flying Squirrel and Gold Star prospects with best drilling results of 15m
at 1.6 g/t Au from 39m, including 6m at 3.49 g/t Au from 48m (GRB0205) and 3m at 1.22 g/t Au (GRB0287)
respectively (ASX announcement 13 January – Quarterly Activities Report December 2012). The north-western
area of the Project containing the Flying Ant and 18 Footer prospects was drilled by previous operators and
returned intersections including 21m at 2.5 g/t from 59m. This area is the interpreted southern extension of
the MBSZ-hosted Golden Ridge Gold Mine, located only 2.5km to the north.

PREVIOUS DRILLING PROGRAMMES

For personal use only

The Project area has been the subject of extensive drilling over selected areas of interest. Approximately 20%
of holes drilled contained an intersection of at least 1m at 0.5 g/t Au, notwithstanding that many holes were
targeting nickel and not gold. Plans showing the extent of previous drilling at the advanced prospects are
shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

PROJECT WORK PROGRAMMES

For personal use only

The review of the Golden Ridge Project has included field reconnaissance, detailed prospect-scale mapping,
surface sampling and, where possible, identification of the locations of historic drill collars and workings. A
compilation and review of drilling data, surface geochemistry and geophysics is also in progress and, combined
with geological mapping, will assist in defining further drill targets at the Project. These are expected to include
currently untested anomalies as well as follow-up of partially defined gold prospects.
In addition to the Golden Ridge Project, historical data reviews and a systematic approach to reviewing the
gold potential at other Pioneer-owned projects considered to be either prospective or under-explored will
continue during the September Quarter.

About Pioneer Resources Limited

For personal use only

Following successful completion of the Sinclair Caesium Mine, Pioneer is now a well-funded and active explorer
focused on key global demand-driven commodities, looking for its next opportunity to create shareholder
wealth through exploration and project development. The Company operates a portfolio of strategically
located lithium, caesium, gold, nickel and cobalt projects in mining regions in Western Australia, plus a highquality lithium asset in Canada.
Lithium:
•
•

The Pioneer Dome LCT Project is highly prospective for lithium, evidenced by the discovery of multiple
spodumene bearing pegmatites in the Dome North area. It includes the Cade Deposit, on which a
maiden JORC Inferred Resource of 8.2 million tonnes @ 1.23% Li2O was estimated in November 2019.
The Company holds a 51% Project interest in the Mavis Lake Lithium Project, Canada where Company
drilling has intersected spodumene.

Gold:
•
•

The Golden Ridge Project is 100% owned by the Company. Exploration over the past 40 years has
identified multiple gold prospects but the effort and focus has been on nickel. The gold potential is
being reappraised and existing and newly identified prospects will be actively explored.
Other Projects in the Company’s portfolio have historically been considered prospective for gold and
a detailed review is being undertaken.

Gold Farmin/Joint Ventures: Pioneer has three free-carried interests with well credentialed JV partners:
• Acra JV Project near Kalgoorlie W.A.: Northern Star Resources Limited (ASX:NST) has earned a 75%
Project Interest and continues to fully fund exploration programmes until a decision to mine with
Pioneer retaining a 25% interest.
• Kangan Project in the West Pilbara W.A: A farmin & JV agreement with Novo Resources Corp
(TSXV.NVO) and Sumitomo Corporation will fully fund gold exploration programmes until a decision to
mine is made, with Pioneer retaining a 30% interest.
• Balagundi Project: A farmin & JV agreement with where Black Cat Syndicate Limited (ASX:BC8) is
earning a 75% interest in the Project located at Bulong, near Kalgoorlie, W.A. Black Cat will then fully
fund gold exploration programmes until a decision to mine is made, with Pioneer retaining a 25%
interest.
Nickel: The Blair-Golden Ridge Project includes the suspended Blair Nickel Sulphide Mine, located between
Kalgoorlie and Kambalda, WA. Near-mine target generation is continuing, with the Company announcing a
new disseminated nickel sulphide drilling discovery at the Leo Dam Prospect in 2018, highlighting the
prospectivity of the greater project area and this work has now been progressed by recent drilling.

Cobalt: Also found as a wide-spread hydromorphic layer throughout the eastern Golden Ridge Project, cobalt
is another commodity with demand expanding in response to its requirement in the manufacture of cobaltbased batteries in certain electric vehicles and electricity stabilisation systems (powerwalls). Other uses for
cobalt include in the manufacture of super-alloys, including jet engine turbine blades, and for corrosion
resistant metal applications.

Appendix 2 – JORC CODE, 2012 Edition – Table 1 Report
Section 1 - Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria

JORC Code explanation

Sampling
techniques

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut Faces, random chips, or specific specialised
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down-hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc).
These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the
appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public
Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which
3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more
explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.

Drilling
techniques

• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger,
Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of
diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so,
by what method, etc).
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results
assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of
the samples.
• Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether
sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse
material.

Drill sample
recovery

15 | P a g e

Commentary
• The majority of drilling comprised RC and RAB drilling completed by previous
operators in multiple campaigns. A small number of diamond holes were also
completed;
• RC, RAB and diamond drilling was completed by previous holders to industry
standard at the time.
• For historic drilling, sampling in mineralised zones comprised 1m samples
however historic sampling methodology was not documented;
• Pioneer RAB drilling used standard industry face sampling blade bit with
samples collected as 3m composites or 1m samples by spear sampling;
• Pioneer drilling included standards and duplicates inserted at regular intervals
to provide assay quality checks.

• Historic RAB drilling was assayed by aqua regia digest.
• Historic drilling includes RC, RAB, air core and diamond techniques. Details on
hole diameter and sampling methods are not known.
• Pioneer RAB drilling used standard 90mm blade bit.
• For Pioneer RAB drilling, sample quality was recorded for each sample and
quality was generally regarded as fit for purpose;
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery on historic drilling are unknown.
• Drill core recovery was determined from physical core measurements
• There is no indication of a relationship between sample recovery and grade.

Logging

• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to
a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies
and metallurgical studies.
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, Face, etc)
photography.
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.

• Geological logging from historic drilling is being compiled and it is likely that the
holes were logged in full;
• Pioneer RAB holes were logged for geology in full capturing lithology,
mineralogy, alteration, sulphide abundance and type, texture, recovery, colour
and recovery noted if poor;
• Pioneer logging is qualitative, and a representative sample is retained in a chip
tray for future reference.

Sub-sampling
techniques and
sample
preparation

• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet
or dry.
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample
preparation technique.
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise
representivity of samples.
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material
collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being
sampled.

Quality of assay
data and
laboratory tests

• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures
used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.
• For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the
parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model,
reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.
• Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates,
external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of
bias) and precision have been established.

Verification of
sampling and
assaying

• The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative
company personnel.
• The use of twinned holes.

• For historic RC and RAB drilling, the sampling technique is unknown other than
1m samples were taken through mineralised zones and 2-5m composite
samples outside of mineralised zones common;
• The method of historic core sampling and size of the core sampled is unknown
other than the downhole width of the sample being 1m;
• Sample preparation was by reputable contract laboratories and is assumed to
be satisfactory;
• In Pioneer RAB holes, samples were collected as 3m composites from 1m
intervals. Anomalous intervals were resampled at 1m intervals;
• Quality control procedures for historic drilling are unknown;
• In Pioneer RAB holes Standard Reference Material and duplicate samples were
included at a rate of 1 per 30 samples to monitor sample preparation and
representivity;
• Due to the industry standard drilling and sampling methods employed in
historic drilling, it is assumed that RC sample size is appropriate for samples
being analysed;
• Sample sizes are considered appropriate.
• All samples were submitted to commercial independent laboratories in
Western Australia;
• It is expected that assay procedures were typically aqua regia for RAB samples
and fire assay for RC and DD samples;
• Pioneer RAB holes were assayed by fire assay;
• Quality control procedures adopted for historic drilling are unknown;
• Pioneer drilling included duplicates and standards inserted approximately every
30 samples and have returned results with acceptable levels of accuracy and
precision.
• No independent validation of data has been carried out and no twinning of
historic holes has yet been carried out;
• Multiple phases of infill drilling have been completed which have provided
confidence in the assay results from different generations of drilling;

Commentary

• Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data
storage (physical and electronic) protocols.
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data.

• Data from historic drilling will have been captured using either hand written
logging sheets or electronic capture;
• Pioneer has a digital SQL drilling database where information is stored.
• Pioneer has made no adjustment to any assay data.

Location of data
points

• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole
surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource
estimation.
• Specification of the grid system used.
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control.

Data spacing and
distribution

• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
• Whether the data spacing, and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of
geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore
Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.
• Whether sample compositing has been applied.

• Historic holes were located either by GPS or total station methods;
• Holes were located on local grids, AMG-84 or GDA-94 and have now all been
transformed to GDA-94;
• Evidence of the drill holes can be seen on high resolution aerial images such as
Google Earth and collars have been cross checked to verify locations;
• The majority of RC and DD holes have down hole surveys but the method was
not documented. RAB drilling was not down hole surveyed;
• Pioneer holes were picked up by DGPS and all are located on GDA-94 (zone 51).
• Drill holes with handheld GPS locations are adjusted to a surface DTM.
• RC and DD drilling in the main prospects was drilled at 20m hole spacing on
cross sections spaced between 20m and 40m apart;
• The data is not currently sufficient to establish geology and grade continuity for
a Mineral Resource Estimate;
• Sample compositing has not been applied prior to reporting intersections.

Orientation of
data in relation
to geological
structure

• Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible
structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key
mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should
be assessed and reported if material.

• The drilling is approximately perpendicular to dip and strike of the known
mineralisation and no orientation based bias has been observed;
• There are a number of vertical first pass RAB holes which may not be drilled in
an optimal direction;

Sample security

• The measures taken to ensure sample security.

Audits or reviews

• The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.

• Measures taken to ensure sample security of historic samples are unknown.
• Pioneer uses standard industry practices when collecting, transporting, and
storing samples for analysis. Pulps are retained by Pioneer off site in a
designated storage container.
• No audits or reviews of the sampling techniques and data have been carried
out.

Commentary
• The Golden Ridge drilling reported herein is entirely within the Golden Ridge
Project on M26/222, M26/284 and E26/186;
• The tenements are located approximately 25km SE of Kalgoorlie WA;
• Golden Ridge North Kambalda Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer
Resources Ltd is the registered holder of the tenements and holds a 100%
unencumbered interest in all minerals within the tenements;
• The tenements are on the Mount Monger Pastoral Lease;
• The Marlinyu Ghoorlie Native Title Claimant Group has a registered Native Title
Claim WC2017/007 that covers the Golden Ridge Project;
• At the time of this Statement, Mining Leases M26/222, M26/284 and Exploration
Licence E26/186 are in Good Standing;
• To the best of the Company’s knowledge, other than industry standard permits
to operate there are no impediments to Pioneer’s operations within the
tenement.
• The majority of work on the project has been completed by previous operators;
• Previous work by Western Mining Corporation (WMC) began in the 1960’s;
• WMC explored for gold in the mid 1990’s and identified most of the gold
prospects on the project;
• Further exploration and gold prospects were followed up by Australian Mines
Limited (AUZ) in the early 2000’s.
• The Golden Ridge Project is situated within the Menzies-Boorara Shear Zone
(MBSZ). There are currently no gold deposits on the Golden Ridge Project, gold
occurrences and prospects are typical Archean orogenic lode-gold targets of the
Eastern Goldfields Terrain and display styles of mineralisation typical to the
nearby Golden Ridge and Boorara deposits (not Pioneer owned);
• Mineralisation is related to NNW trending, parallel shear zones up to 100m wide
and is hosted by a complex stratigraphy including ultramafics, chloritic
sediments, volcanogenic sediments and foliated basalts. The mineralisation is
controlled by a stockwork of quartz veinlets characterised by pervasive sericitesulphide alteration showing strong similarities to other gold deposits within the
MBSZ.
• Refer to Table 1 (body of announcement) and Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 1 of
this announcement.

Data aggregation
methods

•

– elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar, dip and azimuth of the
hole, down hole length and interception depth plus hole length.
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is
not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the
report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are
usually Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and
longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should
be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in
detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly
stated.
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration
Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known,
its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a
clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).

Commentary

• Highlighted intersections noted in the body of the announcement are from 1m
samples using 0.5g/t Au minimum cut-off unless stated;
• All gold intersections within the areas of interest are in Table 3 in Appendix 1
and calculated using a minimum 0.5g/t Au cut off and maximum 4m internal
waste and no external dilution;
• There are no metal equivalent values reported.

mineralisation
widths and
intercept lengths

Diagrams

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be
included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not
be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional
views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.

• Refer to figures and tables in this report.

• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including
(but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.
• The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or
depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main
geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not
commercially sensitive.

• All meaningful and material exploration data has been reported.
