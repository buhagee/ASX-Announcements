Pay down $0.75 million of the $4.0 million loan provided by Pure Asset Management Pty Ltd (Lender)
under a facility agreement dated 15 November 2019 (Facility Agreement). Hydrix and the Lender have
entered into a variation to the Facility Agreement, under which the Company will prepay part of the
outstanding loan without incurring prepayment fees. As part of the variation, the Company has also
negotiated a reduction in the nature and extent of its financial covenants under the Facility Agreement,
thereby providing Hydrix with increased operational flexibility;



Increase the Company’s financial strength and flexibility to navigate COVID-19 disruptions, grow its
Services business and invest in high potential client product innovations; and

Gavin Coote, Executive Chairman of Hydrix said “We are delighted to announce this capital raising which
supports the strategic growth and debt reduction objectives of the business.
“This Entitlement Offer and Placement enable existing shareholders to participate and to bring some new
strategic investors onto the share register.
“In addition, the Company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives in line with the changing revenue
outlook since the beginning of COVID-19 and renegotiated the Pure Asset Management facility to reduce
debt and simplify covenant terms.
“These actions provide a stronger balance sheet and increase operating flexibility to drive the business for
growth in FY21 and beyond,” he said.
