The substantial uplift in customer numbers delivered during FY20 represents a robust outcome in a
challenging year, where the ability of our team to adapt and excel in uncertain economic conditions
was highly evident. To deliver uninterrupted organic growth through the recent COVID induced
uncertainty is both a testament to our highly capable and effective team, as well as a reflection of LPE’s
flexible performance-oriented culture, and the recurring, durable nature of LPE’s core business.

The Company’s FY20 results represent a major step towards the near-term strategic objective of
achieving critical mass and scale in the marketplace. LPE has grown to its present size by pursuing a
strategy of steady organic growth and is now the largest residential embedded network operator in the
South-East Queensland area. However the Board anticipates that in light of recent success with
adjacent growth strategies (direct-market & shared solar) and current operating momentum, the
business is on track to begin to benefit from the tailwinds of significant operating leverage in FY21 and
provide a clear line of sight to near-term sustainable profitability.
As such LPE’s strategic growth opportunity is anticipated to undergo a step-change in FY21. The
Company has now been able to demonstrate a more than 5-year track record of consistent organic
growth and market share gains through varied business conditions, a reflection of our clear competitive
advantage and compelling value proposition. However moving forward the Board believes that the
Company will benefit from a continuation of consistent organic growth, as well as an expanded
opportunity set driven by the Company’s scale and increased financial flexibility in a fragmented market
for smaller energy retailers.

Outlook
With restrictions easing and borders reopening in Queensland this week, business conditions are
anticipated to broadly normalise in the first quarter of FY21 (in the absence of any community
transmission outbreaks). As such the Board believes that the year ahead is likely to provide for improved
sales flexibility given the inherent limitations of sales execution over recent months against a backdrop
of COVID induced movement restrictions. LPE anticipates a further 10,000 customers to be added to
the business over the year, representing healthy growth of ~30%.
Shared Solar
LPE’s emerging and innovative shared solar energy product is anticipated to deliver significant traction
in FY21. The solution facilitates the installation of rooftop solar infrastructure for strata communities,
and the concurrent delivery of material savings on electricity bills with no upfront capital outlay with the
backing of an established and trusted ASX listed strata specialist. It is therefore a compelling option for
strata communities to deliver renewable energy to their residents by overcoming the usual hurdles and
perceived risks faced by body corporates when considering an investment in renewable energy
infrastructure.
Similar to LPE’s core embedded network infrastructure installations, LPE will supply and maintain the
solar system at no capital cost to body corporates or residents, and enter a long-term contract with the
community to manage the supply of low cost solar and traditional grid electricity to residents. LPE then
combines the solar and general grid electricity consumed into a single, easy to understand bill.

LPE’s existing reputation and network of relationships in residential strata communities in South-East
Queensland is pivotal to the deliverability of this strategy. The Company has an existing reputation as
a reliable long-term partner in the deployment of strata electricity infrastructure as well as a customer
focused and service oriented electricity supplier.

LPE’s CEO Damien Glanville said “The Board would like to thank our dedicated staff for their
commitment & dedication over the past five months, as well as our loyal and valued customers for their
support. LPE is proud to provide an independent alternative in electricity supply, and we are dedicated
to unlocking solutions which provide sustained benefits to our customers backed by our friendly local
service team. This customer focused culture is evident in everything we do. The continued growth of
the Company in the past year is a pleasing result, and we look forward to delivering the strategy in
place for the year ahead.”
