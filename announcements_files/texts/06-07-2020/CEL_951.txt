Colorado V Gold Project Assay Results Reinforce the
Discovery of a Large-Scale Gold System
Highlights
•

Drill hole ZK1-5 returned 146 metres at 1.5 g/t gold and 1.8 g/t silver including a significant
high-grade core of 87 metres at 2.1 g/t gold and 1.9 g/t silver.

•

All three drill holes encountered over 100 metres of mineralisation with hole ZK1-3
intercepting a total of 225 metres of significant gold mineralisation

•

Results include (refer Table 1 for details):
▪

146m at 1.5 g/t gold, 1.8 g/t silver from 211 metres (ZK1-5)
(including 87m at 2.1 g/t gold, 1.9 g/t silver from 253 metres)

▪

58m at 0.5 g/t gold, 1.9 g/t silver from 46 metres (ZK1-3) and
(including 30m at 0.8 g/t gold, 3.1 g/t silver from 86 metres)
131m at 0.5 g/t gold, 3.1 g/t silver from 291 metres (ZK1-3)
(including 78m at 0.7 g/t gold, 3.5 g/t silver from 303 metres)

•

Results reinforce the presence of a significant large-scale gold system at the Colorado V
Project in Ecuador

•

The four holes with assays returned all contain mineralisation and cover 80 metres of a 500
metre long trend defined by small scale underground mine workings

•

Mineralisation starts at surface along the 500 metre zone outcropping in a small open pit

•

An additional 5 drill holes have now been sampled and submitted for assay

Commenting on the results, CEL Managing Director, Mr Kris Knauer, said
“Results from these three drill holes are important as they further confirm our discovery of a
significant large-scale gold system.
We were very pleased with drill hole ZK1-5. Not only did it deliver a significant intersection
of 146m at 1.5g/t gold with a high grade interval of 87m a 2.1g/t gold it correlates well with
the high grade portion of our discovery hole 80m along strike.
Our strategy of focusing on Argentina to deliver a high-grade low capex gold mine that can
be used to finance large-scale mining in Ecuador is certainly emerging nicely."

ASX Release

For personal use only

6 July 2020

Challenger Exploration (ASX: CEL) (“CEL” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the results
received for a further three drill holes from the Colorado V concession in Ecuador. These three drill
holes have each intersected over 100 metres of mineralisation, including 146m at 1.5 g/t gold, 1.8 g/t
silver in hole ZK1-5. The results follow our discovery hole, ZK0-2, which intersected over 250 metres of
mineralisation including 134m at 1.0 g/t gold and 4.1 g/t silver and reinforce the discovery of a
significant large-scale gold system in the Colorado V concession in Ecuador.
Highlights include:
 Drill Hole ZK1-5 - 146m at 1.5 g/t gold, 1.8 g/t silver, that contains a higher-grade core of 87m
at 2.1 g/t gold, 1.9 g/t silver. Drill hole ZK1-5 is located 80 metres along strike from the ZK0-2
discovery hole which returned 151m at 0.9 g/t gold and 3.8 g/t silver and also contained a
higher-grade core of 63m at 1.6 g/t gold and 5.1 g/t silver.
 Drill Hole ZK1-3 - intersected 225 metres of mineralisation comprising 58m at 0.5 g/t gold, 1.9
g/t silver from near surface (including 30m at 0.8 g/t gold, 3.1 g/t silver), plus a zone of 131m
at 0.5 g/t gold, 3.1 g/t silver (including 78m at 0.7 g/t gold, 3.5 g/t silver). ZK1-3 Is located
on the same section as ZK1-5 and is believed to have been drilled nearer the margins of the
mineralised domain.
The drill holes are from a series of 60 historical holes drilled by CEL's farm-in partner targeting
extensions to narrow high-grade vein hosted gold mineralisation they are currently exploiting. These
historical drill holes were not systematically logged or assayed for bulk tonnage gold or base metal
mineralisation. The majority of the holes, including the first four holes assayed by the Company, were
drilled on a 500 metre northwest-southeast trend defined by under-ground mine workings.

Discussion of Results
The mineralisation encountered in ZK1-5, ZK1-3 and ZK0-1 is consistent with that encountered in the
ZK0-2 discovery hole (previously announced). The mineralisation is primarily contained within a
diorite and metamorphosed diorite unit. The mineralisation is defined by a 500 metre northwestsoutheast belt of under-ground mine workings which is parallel to a main structural trend in the
region. The diorite unit that hosts the mineralisation is some 200 metres wide and appears to dip to
the northeast at 50-70 degrees. There is also a second zone of mineralisation, as yet not well defined,
located in an overlying intrusive breccia unit.
The current 500 metre long zone of mineralisation shows relatively little geochemical expression,
possibly masked by the larger gold-copper in soil anomalies believed to relate to gold-copper porphyry
mineralisation (see Figures 4). Figure 1 below shows antimony in soil which does appear to image the
mineralisation due to the strong correlation of antimony with the intrusion related gold in the four
holes assayed to date. In addition to the 500 meter strike extent defined by the underground workings
and historical drilling there are two larger antimony in soil anomalies, with coincident gold in soil
anomalies, along strike to the southeast which were not recognised prior to the Company's farm-in.
Challenger is currently undertaking surface exploration and sampling of mineralised outcrop along the
creeks in these anomalies.

Figure 3 shows the location of ZK1-3 and ZK1-5, and the other ZK series of drill holes which are yet to
be logged and assayed. ZK1-5 was drilled across the mineralisation and the intercept is believed to
represent near true width. The intercept correlates with the intercept of 151m at 0.9 g/t gold and 3.8
g/t silver including 63m at 1.6 g/t gold and 5.1 g/t silver 80 metres northwest along strike in ZK0-2.
Drill hole ZK1-3 intersected 225 metres of mineralisation comprising 58m at 0.5 g/t gold, 1.9 g/t silver
from near surface including 30m at 0.8 g/t gold, 3.1 g/t silver, plus a zone of 131m at 0.5 g/t gold, 3.1
g/t silver including 78m at 0.7 g/t gold, 3.5 g/t silver. This hole appears to have been drilled near the
interpreted margins of the mineralised domain.
Figure 4 shows composite gold-copper-molybdenum in soils. This map highlights a number of large
coincident gold-copper-molybdenum soil anomalies which were the Company's main targets prior to
the ZK0-2 intrusion related gold discovery hole. Each anomaly covers approximately 1 km2 and the
limited historical drilling only tested the margins of these anomalies. In drill hole SAK0-1A, which was
drilled the flank of Anomaly B, the Company has logged a zone of over 200 metres of porphyry style
mineralisation containing 1-2% sulphides (pyrite and chalcopyrite) in diorite with potassic alteration
within a broader 500 metre zone of mineralisation. While the focus has switched to prioritising the
assay of drill holes on the current discovery trend the Company remains excited by, and committed
to, assaying the holes which were drilled on the flanks of soil anomalies A, B and C. Each of these
anomalies has the scale to support a significant discovery and are located less than 10km along strike
from Lumina Gold's 17 million-ounce Cangrejos gold discovery(1) which is currently going through

CEL Confirms Discovery of Large-Scale Gold System - 27 May 2020.

About Challenger Exploration
Challenger Exploration Limited's(ASX: CEL) aspiration is to become a globally significant gold producer.
The Company is developing two complimentary gold/copper projects in South America. The strategy
for the Hualilan Gold project is for it to provide a high-grade low capex operation in the near term.
This underpins CEL with a low risk, high margin source of cashflow while it prepares for a much larger
bulk gold operation in Ecuador.
1. Hualilan Gold Project, located in San Juan Province Argentina, is a near term development
opportunity. It has extensive historical drilling with over 150 drill-holes and a non-JORC
historical resource (2) of 627,000 Oz @ 13.7 g/t gold which remains open in most directions.
The project was locked up in a dispute for the past 15 years and as a consequence had seen
no modern exploration until CEL acquired the project in 2019. Results from CEL's first drilling
program included (A) 6.1m @ 34.6 g/t Au, 21.9 g/t Ag, 2.9% Zn, 6.7m @ 14.3 g/t Au, 140 g/t
Ag, 7.3% Zn and 10.3m @ 10.4 g/t Au, 28 g/t Ag, 4.6% Zn. This drilling intersected high-grade
gold over almost 2 kilometres of strike and extended the known mineralisation along strike
and at depth in multiple locations. CEL's 2020 program will include 7,500 metres of drilling,
metallurgical test work of key ore types, and an initial JORC Compliant Resource which will
allow an economic review.
2. El Guayabo Project covers 35 sqkms in southern Ecuador and was last drilled by Newmont
Mining in 1995 and 1997 targeting gold in hydrothermal breccias. Historical drilling has
demonstrated potential to host significant gold and associated copper and silver
mineralisation. Historical drilling has returned a number of intersections of plus 100m of
intrusion related breccia and vein hosted mineralisation. The Project has multiple targets
including breccia hosted mineralization, an extensive flat lying late stage vein system and an
underlying porphyry system target neither of which has been drill tested. CEL's first results
confirm the discovery of large-scale gold system with over 250 metres of bulk gold
mineralisation encountered in drill hole ZK-02 which contains a significant high-grade core of
134 metres at 1.0 g/t gold and 4.1 g/t silver including 63 metres at 1.6 g/t gold and 5.1 g/t
silver

techniques

El Guayabo:
•
Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM) (“Newmont”) and Odin Mining and Exploration Ltd
(TSX: ODN) (“Odin”) core drilled the property between February 1995 and November
1996 across two drilling campaigns.
•
The sampling techniques were reviewed as part of a 43-101 Technical report on
Cangrejos Property which also included the early results of the El Joven joint venture
between Odin and Newmont, under which the work on the El Guayabo project was
undertaken. This report is dated 27 May 2004 and found the sampling techniques and
intervals to be appropriate with adequate QA/QC and custody procedures, core
recoveries generally 100%, and appropriate duplicates and blanks use for determining
assay precision and accuracy.
•
Duplicates were prepared by the Laboratory (Bonder Cleg) which used internal
standards. Newmont also inserted its own standards at 25 sample intervals as a control
on analytical quality
•
Diamond drilling produced core that was sawed in half with one half sent to the
laboratory for assaying per industry standards and the remaining core retained on site.
•
Cu assays above 2% were not re-assayed using a technique calibrated to higher value
Cu results hence the maximum reported assay for copper is 2%.
•
All core samples were analysed using a standard fire assay with atomic absorption finish
on a 30 g charge (30 g FAA). Because of concerns about possible reproducibility
problems in the gold values resulting from the presence of coarse gold, the coarse
crusher rejects for all samples with results greater than 0.5 g/t were re-assayed using
the “blaster” technique - a screen type fire analysis based on a pulverized sample with a
mass of about 5 kg. Samples from most of these intersections were also analysed for
Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn and Ag.
Colorado V:
•
Soil sampling: A database of 4,495 soil analyses has been provided by Goldking Mining
Company S.A. (GK) which has yet to be fully evaluated. No information has been
provided on the method of sample collection or assay technique. The soil analyses
include replicate samples and second split analyses. Pulps have been securely retained
by Goldking Mining Company and have ben made available to CEL for check assaying.
Check assaying is planned, including collection of field duplicates.
•
Selected intervals of drill core have been cut longitudinally and half core has been
submitted for gold determination at GK’s on-site laboratory.

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips,
or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools
appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down
hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These
examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material
to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this
would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was
used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to
produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more
explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold
that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant
disclosure of detailed information.

Re-sampling of the core involves taking ¼ core (where the core has previously been
sampled) or ½ core (where the core has not previously been sampled). The core is cut
longitudinally and sample intervals of 1 – 3 meters have been collected for analysis of
gold by fire assay (30g) and other elements by 4 acid digest with ICP-AES finish at SGS

In a majority of cases core recovery was 100%.
In the historical drill logs where core recoveries were less than 100% the percentage
core recovery was noted.
•
No documentation on the methods to maximise sample recovery was reported in
historical reports however inspection of the available core and historical drilling logs
indicate that core recoveries were generally 100% with the exception of the top few
metres of each drill hole.
•
No material bias has presently been recognised in core.
•
Observation of the core from various drill holes indicate that the rock is generally fairly
solid even where it has been subjected to intense, pervasive hydrothermal alteration and
core recoveries are generally 100%. Consequently, it is expected that the samples
obtained were not unduly biased by significant core losses either during the drilling or
cutting processes
Colorado V:
•
Core from GoldKing has been re-boxed prior to sampling where boxes have
deteriorated, otherwise the original boxes have been retained. Core lengths have been
measured and compared to the depth tags that are kept in the boxes from the drilling
and recovered lengths have been recorded with the logging.
•
Where re-boxing of the core is required, core has ben placed in the new boxes, row-by
row with care taken to ensure all of the core has been transferred.
•
No relationship has been observed between core recovery and sample assay values.

Sub-sampling
techniques and
sample
preparation

-

El Guayabo:
•
Core was cut with diamond saw and half core was taken
•
All drilling was core drilling as such this is not relevant
•
Sample preparation was appropriate and of good quality. Each 1-3 m sample of half core
was dried, crushed to a nominal – 10 mesh (ca 2mm), then 250 g of chips were split out
and pulverized. A sub-sample of the pulp was then sent for analysis for gold by standard
fire assay on a 30 g charge with an atomic absorption finish with a nominal 5 ppb Au
detection limit.
•
Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material
collected is not outlined in the historical documentation however a program of reassaying was undertaken by Odin which demonstrated the repeatability of original assay
results
•
The use of a 1-3 m sample length is appropriate for deposits of finely disseminated
mineralisation where long mineralised intersections are to be expected.
Colorado V:
•
No information is available on the method/s that have been used to collect the soil
samples.
•
Selected intervals of drill core have been cut longitudinally using a diamond saw and ½
core has been sampled. Sample intervals range from 0.1m to 4.5m with an average
length of 1.35m. The size of the samples is appropriate for the mineralisation observed
in the core.
•
Re-sampling of the core involves cutting of ¼ core (where previously sampled) or ½ core
where not previously sampled. ¼ or ½ core over intervals of 1-3 metres provides an
adequate sample size for the material being sampled.
El Guayabo:
•
The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used
by Newmont and Odin are still in line with industry best practice with appropriate QA/QC
and chain of custody and are considered appropriate.
•
Available historical data does not mention details of geophysical tools as such it is
believed a geophysical campaign was not completed in parallel with the drilling
campaign.
•
Duplicates were prepared by the Laboratory (Bonder Cleg) which used internal
standards. Newmont also inserted its own standards at 25 sample intervals as a control
on analytical quality. Later Odin undertook a re-assaying program of the majority of the
higher grade sections which confirmed the repeatability.
•
Given the above, it is considered acceptable levels of accuracy and precision have been

royalties on the project other than normal Ecuadorian government royalties.
The property has no historical sites, wilderness or national park issues.
The mining title grants the owner an exclusive right to perform mining activities, including,
exploration, exploitation and processing of minerals over the area covered by the prior
title for a period of 25 years, renewable for a further 25 years. Under its option agreement,
the owner has been granted a negative pledge (which is broadly equivalent to a fixed and
floating charge) over the concession. In addition a duly notarized Irrevocable Promise to

El Oro, Ecuadorwas granted in compliance with the Mining Act (“MA”) in on July 17, 2001.
It is adjacent to El Guayabo concession to the north. The concession is held by Goldking
Mining Company S.A. There are no overriding royalties on the project other than normal
Ecuadorian government royalties.
The concession has no historical sites, wilderness or national park issues.
The El Guayabo 2 Guayabo (Code. 300964) mining concession is located Torata parish,
Santa Rosa canton, El Oro province, Ecuador. The concession is held by T Mr. Segundo
Ángel Marín Gómez and Mrs. Hermida Adelina Freire Jaramillo and was granted in
compliance with the Mining Act (“MA”) on 29April 29, 2010. There are no overriding
royalties on the project other than normal Ecuadorian government royalties.
The property has no historical sites, wilderness or national park issues.
El Guayabo:
Previous exploration on the project has been undertaken by Newmont and Odin from
1994 to 1997. This included surface pit and rock chip geochemistry, followed by the
drilling of 33 drill holes for a total of 7605.52 meters) to evaluate the larger geochemical
anomalies.
The collection of all exploration data by Newmont and Odin was of a high standard and
had appropriate sampling techniques and intervals, adequate QA/QC and custody
procedures, and appropriate duplicates and blanks used for determining assay precision
and accuracy.
The geological interpretation of this data, including core logging and follow up geology
was designed and directed by in-country inexperienced geologists. It appears to have
been focused almost exclusively for gold targeting surface gold anomalies or the depth
extensions of higher-grade gold zones being exploited by the artisanal miners. The
geologic logs for all drill holes did not record details that would have been typical, industry
standards for porphyry copper exploration at that time. A number of holes which ended in
economic mineralisation have never been followed up.
In short, important details which would have allowed the type of target to be better
explored were missed which in turn presents an opportunity to the current owner.
Colorado V:
All exploration known has been completed by GK. Drilling has been done from 2016 to
2019. 56 drill holes, totaling 21,471.83m have been completed by GK.
El Guaybo 2:
Exploration work undertaken by the previous owner was limited to field mapping and
sampling including assaying of a small number of samples for gold, silver, copper, lead
and zinc. The report is only available in Spanish and assays were conducted in a local
laboratory in Ecuador with the majority of this work undertaken in 2017.

It is believed that the El Guayabo, El Guayabo 2, and Colorado V concessions contain a
“Low Sulfide” porphyry gold copper system and intrusive-related gold. The host rocks for
the intrusive complex is metamorphic basement and Oligocene – Mid-Miocene volcanic
rocks. This suggests the intrusions are of a similar age to the host volcanic sequence,
which also suggests an evolving basement magmatic system. Intrusions are described in
the core logs as quartz diorite and dacite. Mineralisation has been recognized in:
–
Steeply plunging breccia bodies and in the metamorphic host rock adjacent to
the breccia (up to 200 m in diameter)
–
Quartz veins and veinlets
–
Disseminated pyrite and pyrrhotite in the intrusions and in the metamorphic host
rock near the intrusions.
El Guayabo and Colorado V Drill results are provided below.
Location data for the Colorado V drilling is provided below. Colorado V drill results are currently being compiled. No
summary of data is available at this time, and no drill hole assay results have been reported.

Quantec Geophysical services conducted a SPARTAN Broadband Magnetotelluric and TITAN
IP/EMAP surveys completed February 3rd to April 1st, 2019 over the El Guayabo property by
Quantec Geoscience Ltd. on behalf of AAR Resources.
The survey covered 16 square kilometersa with data collected on 300m 3D spacing on a gride
oriented at 10 degerees and 100 degerees. The grid was moved 10 degrees so the survey could
be orineted perpendicu;lar to the main geological srtuctures. The survey involved a total of 205
Magnetotelluric (MT) sites and 2 test TITAN IP/EMAP profiles were surveyed
The final survey results to which will be delivered will consist of :

DCIP INVERSION PROCEDURES
DCIP is an electrical method that uses the injection of current and the measurement of voltage
difference along with its rate of decay to determine subsurface resistivity and chargeability
respectively. Depth of investigation is mainly controlled by the array geometry but may also be
limited by the received signal (dependent on transmitted current) and ground resistivity.
Chargeability is particularly susceptible to data with a low signal-to-noise ratio. The differences
in penetration depth between DC resistivity and chargeability are a function of relative property
contrasts and relative signal-to-noise levels between the two measurements. A detailed
introduction to DCIP is given in Telford, et al. (1976). The primary tool for evaluating data is
through the inversion of the data in two or three dimensions. An inversion model depends not
only on the data collected, but also on the associated data errors in the reading and the “model
norm”. Inversion models are not unique and may contain “artefacts” from the inversion process.
The inversion model may not accurately reflect all the information apparent in the actual data.
Inversion models must be reviewed in context with the observed data, model fit, and with an
understanding of the model norm used.
The DC and IP inversions use the same mesh. The horizontal mesh is set as 2 cells between
electrodes. The vertical mesh is designed with a cell thickness starting from 20 m for the first
hundred metres to accommodate the topographic variation along the profiles, and then

increases logarithmically with depth. The inversions were generally run for a maximum of 50
iterations. The DC data is inverted using an unconstrained 2D inversion with a homogenous
half-space of average input data as starting model. For IP inversions, the apparent chargeability
is computed by carrying out two DC resistivity forward models with conductivity distributions
𝝈(𝒙𝒊,𝒛𝒋) and (𝟏−𝜼)𝝈(𝒙𝒊,𝒛𝒋) (Oldenburg and Li, 1994), where (𝒙𝒊,𝒛𝒋) specifies the location in a 2D
mesh. The conductivity distributions used in IP inversions can be the inverted DC model or a
half space of uniform conductivity. Two IP inversions are then calculated from the same data
set and parameters using different reference models. The first inversion of the IP data uses the
previously calculated DC model as the reference model and is labelled the IP dcref model. The
second IP inversion uses a homogeneous half-space resistivity model as the reference model
and is labelled IP hsref model. This model is included to test the validity of chargeability
anomalies, and to limit the possibility of inversion artefacts in the IP model due to the use of the
DC model as a reference. The results of this second IP inversion are presented on the digital
archived attached to this report.
MAGNETOTELLURIC INVERSIONS
The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is a natural source EM method that measures the variation of
both the electric (E) and magnetic (H) field on the surface of the earth to determine the
distribution at depth of the resistivity of the underlying rocks. A complete review of the method
is presented in Vozoff (1972) and Orange (1989).
The measured MT impedance Z, defined by the ratio between the E and H fields, is a tensor of
complex numbers. This tensor is generally represented by an apparent resistivity (a parameter
proportional to the modulus of Z) and a phase (argument of Z). The variation of those
parameters with frequency relates the variations of the resistivity with depth, the high
frequencies sampling the sub-surface and the low frequencies the deeper part of the earth.
However, the apparent resistivity and the phase have an opposite behaviour. An increase of the
phase indicates a more conductive zone than the host rocks and is associated with a decrease
in apparent resistivity. The objective of the inversion of MT data is to compute a distribution of
the resistivity of the surface that explains the variations of the MT parameters, i.e. the response
of the model that fits the observed data. The solution however is not unique and different
inversions must be performed (different programs, different conditions) to test and compare
solutions for artefacts versus a target anomaly.
An additional parameter acquired during MT survey is the Tipper. Tipper parameters Tzx and
Tzy (complex numbers) represent the transfer function between the vertical magnetic field and
the horizontal X (Tzx), and Y (Tzy) magnetic fields respectively (as the impedance Z represent
the transfer function between the electric and magnetic fields). This tipper is a ‘local’ effect,
mainly defined by the lateral contrast of the resistivity. Consequently, the tipper can be used to
estimate the geological strike direction. Another important use of the tipper is to display its
components as vectors, named induction vectors. The induction vectors (defined by the real
components of Tzx and Tzy) plotted following the Parkinson-Real-Reverse-Angle convention

will point to conductive zones. The tipper is then a good mapping tool to delineate more
conductive zones.
The depth of investigation is determined primarily by the frequency content of the measurement.
Depth estimates from any individual sounding may easily exceed 20 km. However, the data can
only be confidently interpreted when the aperture of the array is comparable to the depth of
investigation.
The inversion model is dependent on the data, but also on the associated data errors and the
model norm. The inversion models are not unique, may contain artefacts of the inversion
process and may not therefore accurately reflect all the information apparent in the actual data.
Inversion models need to be reviewed in context with the observed data, model fit. The user
must understand the model norm used and evaluate whether the model is geologically plausible.
For this project, 2D inversions were performed on the TITAN/EMAP profiles data. For each
profile, we assume the strike direction is perpendicular to the profile for all sites: the TM mode
is then defined by the inline E-field (and cross line H-field); no TE mode (crossline E-field)
were used in the 2D inversions.
The 2D inversions were performed using the TM-mode resistivity and phase data interpolated
at 6 frequencies per decade, assuming 10% and 5% error for the resistivity and phase
respectively, which is equivalent to 5% error on the impedance component Z. No static shift of
the data has been applied on the data.
The 3D inversion was carried out using the CGG RLM-3D inversion code. The 3D inversions of
the MT data were completed over an area of approximately 5km x 3.5km. All MT sites from this
current survey were used for the 3D inversion.
The 3D inversion was completed using a sub sample of the MT data with a maximum of 24
frequencies at each site covering the measured data from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a nominal 4
frequencies per decade. At each site, the complete MT complex impedance tensors (Zxx, Zxy,
Zyx, and Zyy) were used as input data with an associated error set to 5% on each parameter.
The measured tipper data (Tzx, Tzy) were also used as input data with an associated error set
to 0.02 on each parameter. A homogenous half space with resistivity of 100 Ohm-m was used
as the starting model for this 3D MT inversion. A uniform mesh with 75 m x 75 m cell size was
used in horizontal directions in the resistivity model. The vertical mesh was defined to cover the
first 4 km. Padding cells were added in each direction to accommodate the inversion for
boundary conditions. The 3D inversion was run for a maximum of 50 iterations.
In addition a total of 129 samples distributed along 12 holes were analysed to measure the
resistivity (Rho (Ohm*m) and chargeability properties (Chargeability M and Susceptibility
(SCPT 0.001 SI) . The equipment used for the analyses was the Sample Core IP Tester,
manufactured by Instrumentation GDD Inc. It should be noted that these measures should be
taken only as first order estimate, and not as “absolute” (true) value as readings by the field
crew were not repeated and potentially subject to some errors (i.e. wrong size of the core
entered in the equipment).

Commentary

The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions,
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling
areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.

No additional substantive work is known.
El Guaybo Project
Re-logging and re-assaying core including SWIR/alteration mapping to better vector on
the porphyry and breccia targets – available assays 6 elements only, no SWIR, and not
logged by porphyry experts. The Company understands that this is complete with assays
being waitied on.
Channel sampling of the adit and artisanal workings - > 1km of underground exposure of
the system which has never been systematically mapped or sampled.
Sampling of additional breccia bodies – only 2 of the 10 known breccias have been
systematically defined and properly sampled.
Complete interpretation of the 3D MT survey (with IP lines) covering 16 sq. This will
include integration of all the geological data and constrained inversion modelling
MMI soil survey covering 16 sq kms
The aim of the program above is to define targets for a drilling program
