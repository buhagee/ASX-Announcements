SIGNIFICANT INTERVALS OF HIGH‐GRADE GOLD‐COPPER
MINERALISATION IN FIRST HOLE AT TRUNDLE
Assays of up to 4.32g/t Au and 2.43% Cu within 51m intercept grading 1.17g/t gold and
0.54% Cu; broad anomalous zone intersected in adjacent porphyry intrusion

HIGHLIGHTS
 First diamond drill hole at the Trundle Project, NSW has intersected multiple significantly
mineralised skarn zones at the Trundle Park target:
–
51m @ 1.17 g/t gold and 0.54% copper from 39m, including:
 20.5m @ 1.94 g/t gold and 1.18% copper from 57.6m, including:
o 8m @ 3.07 g/t gold and 1.95% copper from 57.6m, and
o 2.2m @ 4.32 g/t gold and 2.43% copper from 75.9m
–
18m @ 0.53 g/t gold and 0.05% copper from 284m, including:
 3m @ 1.80 g/t gold and 0.18% copper from 284m
 Hole TRDD001 also intersected the targeted adjacent porphyry intrusion system with a
broad zone of anomalous mineralisation intersected, including:
–
21.1m @ 0.25 g/t gold and 0.03% copper from 664m to end‐of‐hole
 Assay results represent the most significant mineralised intervals to date at the Trundle
Project and the targeted setting of a high‐grade gold‐copper skarn and adjacent porphyry
intrusion.
 Assays expected within two weeks from the Mordialloc target, where significant intervals
with visually interpreted localized moderate copper grades and inner propylitic zone
alteration were identified.
 Second hole recently completed at Trundle Park (detailed core review underway) and first
hole currently being drilled at the Baileys target.
 Follow‐up hole to commence at Mordialloc in July.

RareX Limited (“the Company”, “RareX”) (ASX: REE) is pleased to report assay results from the
first diamond drill‐hole completed at the Trundle Gold‐Copper Project Joint Venture in NSW
with Kincora Copper Limited (“Kincora”; TSX‐V: KCC). The Trundle Project is a 65%: 35% JV
between Kincora and RareX.
The hole, TRDD001, has intersected multiple significant intervals of high‐grade shallow gold and
copper skarn mineralisation, as well as a deeper broad anomalous interval of gold‐copper
mineralisation within the targeted porphyry intrusion system.

John Holliday, Kincora Technical Committee chair, and Peter Leaman, Kincora Senior VP of
Exploration, commented: “We are extremely pleased and excited by the results of this first hole,
it is not often you see such high grades near surface within a porphyry environment.”
“Assay results support previously announced visual interpretations of multiple zones of
significant gold and copper mineralisation. This supports the skarn being a standalone target at
depths and intervals often mined by both open cut and underground methods, but the high‐grade
zones within broader moderate mineralised zones are very importantly illustrating significant
magmatic fluids associated with the adjacent porphyry intrusion system, which is a much larger
target.”
The skarn and porphyry intrusion system setting intersected at the Trundle Park target is a
common geological setting of many large porphyry systems. Within the Macquarie Arc, the Big
and Little Cadia skarns at Cadia, and were important to the discovery of multiple adjacent
causative intrusions and deposits that make up the largest porphyry system in Australia.
The fourth hole of the ongoing maiden Kincora drilling program at the Trundle Project, and
follow‐up hole to TRDD001, has recently been completed at the Trundle Park target (detailed
review of core pending) with drilling activities remobilized to complete the previously
announced third hole at the Bayleys porphyry target.
Assay results from Kincora’s second hole at the Mordialloc target (TRDD002) are expected within
two weeks. As announced on June 10th 2020, TRDD002 intersected strong alteration halo
indicators of a mineralised porphyry intrusion system, supporting the targeted geological setting
of a high‐level, preserved porphyry system.
These indicators include significant intervals with visually interpreted localized moderate copper
grades and inner propylitic zone alteration. A follow‐up hole at the Mordialloc target is expected
to commence in July.
RareX Executive Director, Jeremy Robinson, commented: “Achieving such significant intervals of
high‐grade mineralisation in the very first exploration drill‐hole at the Trundle Project is an
outstanding result, and a credit to the Kincora team. We are now eagerly awaiting assays from
the second hole at Mordialloc, where we recently reported very encouraging visual results, and
seeing what the next few holes can deliver.
“The Kincora team has done an exceptional job in achieving results so quickly from what is now
clearly the best porphyry exploration project in NSW behind Alkane’s Boda Project.”

The Trundle Project
The Trundle project is located 30km west of the China Molybdenum Company Limited (“CMOC”)
operated Northparkes copper‐gold project, in the same Northparkes Igneous Complex.
Past explorer drilling has been extensive with the completion of 2208 holes for 61,146 metres
but deeper drilling utilising modern exploration knowledge has been very limited.
Over 92% of prior drilling has been to less than 50 metres depth, a depth that the existing major
mines in this belt suggest is just too shallow, with just 11 holes beyond 300 metres (0.5% of holes
drilled).
Existing significant drill intersections supports vectoring to very compelling targets for ongoing
phase 1 drilling program at three existing mineralised systems – Trundle Park, Mordialloc and
Bayleys. These systems have not been drilled since industry leading Induced Polarisation
survey's, including HPX’s proprietary Typhoon system, and magnetic modelling were completed.

Drilling Techniques

Drill Sample
Recovery

JORC Code Explanation
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation,
such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples
should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the
appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple
(eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation
may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.

Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open‐ hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger,
Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of
diamond tails, face‐sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by
what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results
assessed.
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the
samples.
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether
sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.

The Trundle Park prospect at the Trundle Project was drill tested by our
Joint Venture partner, Kincora Copper Limited with Diamond Drill core by
DrillIt Consulting Pty Ltd.
Diamond drilling was used to obtain orientated samples from the ground,
which was then structurally, geotechnically and geologically logged
Sample interval selection was based on geological controls and
mineralization
Sampling was completed to industry standards with ¼ core for PQ
diameter diamond core and ½ core for HQ and NQ diameter diamond core
sent to the lab for each sample interval
Samples were assayed via the following methods:
‐ Gold: Au‐AA24 (Fire assay)
‐ Multiple elements: ME‐MS61 (4 acid digestion with ICP‐AES & ICP‐MS
analysis for 48 elements)
‐ Copper oxides and selected intervals with native copper: ME‐ICP44 (Aqua
regia digestion with ICP‐AES analysis) has been assayed, but not reported
‐ Assay results >10g/t gold and/or 1% copper are re‐assayed
Diamond Drilling (DD) completed using PQ diameter 0.0‐50.85m; HQ3
50.85‐185.80; NQ2 185.80‐273.00m; HQ3 273.00‐685.05

Systematic geological, structural and geotechnical logging was completed
by Kincora geologists and consultant
The detail of logging was appropriated for the understanding and sampling
of this style of mineralization
Drill core was photographed

Once all geological information was extracted from the drill core, the
sample intervals were cut in half with an Almonte automatic core saw,
bagged and delivered to the laboratory.
This is an appropriate sampling technique for this style of mineralization
and is the industry standard for sampling of diamond drill core.

The reported assays were analyzed by ALS. The following techniques were
used:

Gold: Au‐AA24 (Fire assay), reported.

Multiple elements: ME‐ICP61 (4 acid digestion with ICP‐AES analysis for 33
elements) and ME‐MS61 (4 acid digestion with ICP‐AES & ICP‐MS analysis
for 48 elements), the latter reported.

Copper oxides and selected intervals with native copper: ME‐ICP44 (Aqua
regia digestion with ICP‐AES analysis), sampled but not reported.

Assay results >10g/t gold and/or 1% copper are re‐assayed using an
appropriate assay method
In addition to internal checks by ALS, Kincora incorporates a QA/QC sample
protocol utilizing prepared standards and blanks for 5% of all assayed samples.

Significant intercepts were calculated by Kincora’s geological staff.

No twinned drill holes have been completed.

The intercepts have not been verified by independent personal

Drill hole
information

A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results
including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:
easting and northing of the drill hole collar
elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill
hole collar
dip and azimuth of the hole
down hole length and interception depth
hole length.
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not
Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or
minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut‐off grades are usually
Material and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer
lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated
and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.

Significant intercepts were calculated using weighted averaging
Interpreted near surface skarn gold and copper intercepts are calculated
using a lower cut of 0.20g/t and 0.10% respectively. Internal dilution is
below cut off. Interpreted near surface skarn gold and copper intercepts
for drill hole TRDD001 are located between 39m and 90m.

For personal use only

The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly
stated.



Porphyry gold and copper intercepts are calculated using a lower cut of
0.10g/t and 0.05% respectively. Internal dilution is below cut off.
Porphyry gold and copper intercepts for drill hole TRDD001 are located
between 284m and end of hole at 685.1m.

Relationship
between
mineralisation
widths and
intercept
lengths

These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its
nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear
statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).



Geometry of the shallow mineralised skarn appears to be dipping
moderately to the east with faulting to the west. Drill hole TRDD001 was
drilled at a perpendicular angle to the dip of the mineralised skarn .
Geometry of the deeper mineralised zones, including true width, is
unknown due to lack of drill density

Diagrams

Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be
included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be
limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced
to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but
not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey
results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.
