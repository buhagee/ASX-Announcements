Dear Madeleine,
TRADING HALT REQUEST
In accordance with Listing Rule 17.1, the Directors of Bardoc Gold Limited (Company) hereby request
a trading halt of the Company’s securities (“BDC”) pending the release of an announcement by the
Company regarding a significant capital raising.
In support of this request the Company advises: 1. The reason for the trading halt is that the Company is finalising a capital raising and believes
this trading halt will allow sufficient time to finalise documentation and prepare an
announcement to the market on or before the commencement of trading on Wednesday 8th
July 2020.
2. It is expected that this announcement will end the trading halt.
3. The Company is not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be granted nor is
there any other information to inform the market about the trading halt.
By order of the Board
Bardoc Gold Limited
