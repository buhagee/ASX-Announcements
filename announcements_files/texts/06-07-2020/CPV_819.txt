6 July 2020: Smart building materials company ClearVue Technologies Limited (ASX:CPV) (“ClearVue” or “the
Company”) is pleased to announce that it has signed a Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement with Insulsteel
Building Sciences, LLC of Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America (“Insulsteel”).
Insulsteel is an award winning1 design and build firm and leading manufacturer of a steel-frame insulated
construction roof and wall panelized building component system. The core of the Insulsteel building process is the
mass production of structural steel insulated panels and precision engineered components used in designing,
manufacturing, and constructing insulated steel framed building enclosures. Insulsteel has been operating for 20
years in the US market selling its panels and system in the Southern US States of Georgia and South Carolina.
Insulsteel is in the process of expanding its manufacturing and distribution footprint from one location in
Charleston to a further twenty (20) factories across US states. Under the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement
Insulsteel will manufacture and supply the ClearVue PV IGUs for its own use and sale as a part of its new
IntelAwall™ insulated wall panel system with the ClearVue IGU panels being introduced into the wall panels at the
time of fabrication for delivery of completed wall sections straight to client construction sites to minimise build
time.
Under the terms of the Agreement, Insulsteel secures exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the ClearVue IGU’s
when combined into and sold as part of its IntelAwall™ steel insulated building system. ClearVue is not prevented
from appointing other manufacturers and distributors in the US including for use with other building systems and
methods that are not substantially similar to Insulsteel’s system in that the framing system is not a modular
prefabricated panel-based system comprised primarily of steel and EPS insulative material.

Insulsteel system when combined with the highly insulative, energy efficient and energy generating features
of ClearVue’s IGU design make for an extremely energy efficient building. The team at Insulsteel love what

“Insulsteel is very pleased to be working with ClearVue on the integration of ClearVue’s solar PV windows
into our highly energy efficient building system. We are looking to significantly scale production of our own
EcoShell panels throughout the US and to manufacturing and including the ClearVue products and
technology with this new push. We think that ClearVue’s product is a perfect fit for inclusion into our Zero
Energy Designs and brings a fantastic point of difference to our already category leading products and
solutions. We have a number of pipeline projects where we would seek to include the ClearVue product and
will work with ClearVue to purchase the ClearVue products through ClearVue directly until such time as we
can establish our own IGU manufacturing plant. We look forward to a long future with ClearVue as our new
partner and to collectively change the face of the approximate US $1.1 Trillion commercial and residential
new construction market.”
