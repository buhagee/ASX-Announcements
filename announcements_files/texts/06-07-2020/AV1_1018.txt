ASX RELEASE

6 July 2020

Chief Executive Officer’s Contract Extended
The Board of Adveritas Limited (Adveritas or Company) is pleased to announce that it has
agreed with its Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Mr Mathew Ratty, to extend
the term and vary the remuneration of his Executive Services Agreement with the Company
(Service Agreement).
The term of Mr Ratty’s Service Agreement has been extended to 30 June 2023. The Board of
Adveritas considers this extension to be of material benefit to the Company as it continues
to execute its current strategy.
Adveritas Chairman, Stephen Belben, said “The Board is pleased to have Mat extend his
contract. We have reviewed management’s strategy and considered our key personnel and
we believe that Mat is well placed to lead the Company to achieve its aggressive growth
targets. The Board looks forward to further expansion and clients wins (particularly across
the United States) to add shareholder value”.
In addition to Mr Ratty’s Service Agreement being extended, his annual remuneration has
been increased to $290,000 per annum (plus superannuation) with effect from 1 August
2020. This coincides with the date that Non-executive Director fees and executive and staff
salaries return to the levels they were in March 2020, prior to the implementation of
significant voluntary reductions to mitigate the impact COVID-19 on the Company. All other
terms of Mr Ratty’s Service Agreement remain the same.
The Board has also agreed, subject to shareholder approval being obtained, to issue
4,500,000 Performance Rights to Mr Ratty with the following performance milestones:
