Dear Madam,
BIT225 REVERSES HIV-INDUCED IMMUNE EVASION

The Directors of Biotron Limited (‘Biotron’) are pleased to advise that the Company is presenting new data on its
lead HIV-1 drug, BIT225, this week at the 23rd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2020). The data indicate
that via its inhibition of the HIV-1 viral protein Vpu, BIT225 enhances the immune response to HIV.
BIT225 is unique in its ability to both directly inhibit the virus and augment the immune responses against it.
The Company has previously reported that its BIT225-009 Phase 2 HIV-1 clinical trial demonstrated safety and
tolerability, as well as the expected viral suppression in those treated with standard anti-HIV drugs (ART) alone or
with ART plus BIT225. The BIT225 group also showed statistically significant changes in key immune cell
populations. The new data being presented this week at the conference explain the mechanisms by which BIT225
induces these changes.
“The latest results provide key information on how BIT225 directly modifies immune responses to HIV-1
infection. It helps explain the immune changes that we saw in the Phase 2 clinical trial and gives us even more
confidence in our product”, said Dr Michelle Miller, Biotron’s Managing Director.
During HIV-1 infection, in order to attenuate host immune responses against the virus, specific cell surface markers
that normally signal the immune system to attack the virus are downregulated. This downregulation enables the
virus to evade the immune response and persist. These cells constitute a reservoir for the virus that enables it to
persist despite ART.
The new data show that BIT225 restores these cell surface markers to normal. In addition, the new data also
indicate that BIT225 increases a key marker linked to functionality, meaning that T cells are able to move around
the body and restore immune function.
The Vpu protein of HIV-1 is largely responsible for downregulation of cell surface markers that attenuate immune
responses. This new study used wild-type virus as well as virus that had Vpu removed to show that BIT225’s
effects on the immune system are mediated directly through its inhibition of Vpu. These effects are additional to
the known antiviral effect of BIT225.
The new data support and further extend Biotron’s previous report that BIT225 “unmasks” HIV-infected cells and
promotes immune recognition of the virus. Immune system recognition initiates the host defence processes
including the clearance of virus.
In combination with results from the Phase 2 clinical trial, the results reported here support further clinical study of
the potential anti-viral and immunological benefits of BIT225 therapy in combination with ART.

2. T CELL HOMING and DIFFERENTIATION FUNCTION: CD4+/ CCR7

For personal use only

BACKGROUND
Chronic HIV-1 infection occurs in-part because the virus encodes
accessory proteins to misdirect the host immune system so that HIV-1infected cells can survive and propagate virus. In a recent Phase 2 clinical
trial (BIT225-009) the addition of BIT225 to Atripla ® therapy resulted in a
delayed decline in CD4+ T cell activation. This in vitro study investigated if
there was a Vpu-dependent mechanism that could result in better
activation and function of CD4+ T cells during ART. The costimulatory
receptor of T cell activation is CD28 and its counterparts are CD80 and
CD86 on macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells. Experiments were
designed to identify the role of accessory proteins Vpu and Nef expression
on CD4+ T cell activation and homing plasma membrane (PM) receptor
expression on CD4+ T cells (CD28, CCR7 respectively) and monocytederived macrophages (MDM)(CD80, CD86).

BIT225, a Vpu inhibitor, is able to counteract the HIV-1
induced downregulation of key cellular receptors
essential for T cell activation and response
METHODS
CD4+ T cells and monocytes were extracted from the blood of three donors. MDM were grown in culture from monocytes
isolated from PBMCs. The MDM or CD4+ T cells were infected with VSVG-pseudotyped wildtype, Vpu-, Nef- and Vpu-/NefHIV-1NL4-3. The expression of PM receptors CD28, CCR7, CD80 and CD86 was measured by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis of
the data was performed by ANOVA.

RESULTS
HIV-1NL4-3 infection of CD4+ T cells results in downmodulation of PM expression of CD28 and CCR7. Downregulation of CD28 and
CCR7 is induced by Vpu expression. CD28 and CCR7 are expression also impacted by Nef. BIT225 treatment increases the
expression of CD28 and CCR7 in a Vpu-dependent manner. Infection of MDM with VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-1NL4-3 resulted in
decreased expression of CD80 and CD86. BIT225 treatment of MDM infected with VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-1NL4-3 resulted in a
partial reversal of downmodulation of CD86 which was partially Vpu-independent. BIT225 treatment partially restores CD80
expression. The effect on CD80 expression is Vpu-dependent. BIT225 had no observable effect on Vpu-/Nef- HIV-1NL4-3 mutants,
primarily because double deletion of Vpu and Nef returns receptors to uninfected levels.

BIT225 increases CD28, CD80/86
plasma membrane expression in
HIV-1 infected cells

HIV-1 infection down regulates plasma
membrane expression of CD28 and
CD80/CD86 predominantly by Vpu and
Nef.

CD4+/CD28+ T cells

1. CD4+ T CELL RECEPTOR FUNCTION
Two steps are required for T cell activation:
A. The binding of the PM TCR(CD3) on the T cell with its partner
MHC/antigen complex on PM of APC. Binding of the CD4+ coreceptor.
B. The costimulatory binding of T cell PM CD28 with its partner receptor,
either CD80 or CD86, on PM of APC.

HIV-1 utilizes 2 accessory proteins, Vpu and Nef , to reduce the efficacy of
the costimulatory TCR recognition step by decreasing the PM expression the
key receptors on both CD4+ T cells and MDM (Ramirez et al., 2019). This
redundancy implies it is an important mechanism for HIV-1 to hide from
the immune system. This is the first report of therapeutic intervention
(BIT225) of this process that may have important implications for future
treatment strategies. The data is consistent with the sustained increased
plasma CD4+ T cell numbers observed in vivo during 12 weeks of Atripla®
and 200 mg QD of BIT225 (Avihingsanon et al., 2018, Avihingsanon et al.,
2020).

Statistical methods: Data were converted to “fold-change”
by division with Donor- and Time- matched values from the
untreated WT.NL4.3 dataset. Two-way ANOVA was used to
statistically assess the within-virus difference between
BIT225 treated and untreated means. The linear model:
Fold-Change = β0 + β1*Time+ β2*IBIT225 was fitted to the
dataset (N=18) for each virus which included measurements
from three donors at three time-points (24h, 48h & 72h);
either treated with BIT225 (3 mM) or not (DMSO control).
The P-values for whether the estimate of β2 was significantly
non-zero are summarised by the asterisks in Figures 1 to 3:

Dysfunction of Signal 2 promotes T cell
anergy
(inactive/hyporesponsive)
or
apoptosis.

This study investigates the potential modulation of B7 family molecules
(CD28, CD80 and CD86) that are essential for the co-stimulatory signaling of
the TCR. Approximately 95% of plasma CD4+ T cells express CD28 and they
are abundant on both resting and activated T cells. The two step TCR
signaling combination has 3 outcomes. If the TCR and CD28 are engaged, it
results in IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression which drives T cell
proliferation and differentiation to become a limited number of subtypes. If
the TCR is ligated alone then the T cell enters a state of anergy or apoptosis.
If only the CD28 is ligated, there is no effect.

HIV-1 down regulates MHC
class I expression important
for CD4+ T cell recognition of
viral antigen. This MHC class-1
is modulated by Vpu (HLA-C)
and Nef (HLA-A/B).

T cell function/differentiation is affected by the environment and education
the cell is exposed to during its circulation through the blood and immune
tissues/organs. A critical homing signal is the expression of PM Chemokine
receptor 7 (CCR7). This study determined that PM CCR7 expression on CD4+
T cells was decreased by HIV-1 infection. The PM expression of CCR7 was
reduced when Vpu was expressed. This Vpu dependence on CCR7
expression was eliminated by treatment with BIT225. This data suggest that
CD4+ T cell function may be improved when BIT225 is added to ART .

HIV-1 infection downregulates PM expression
of CCR7 on CD4+ T cells.

Figure 1. Plasma Membrane expression of CD28 on CD4+ T cells treated with 3 mM of
BIT225 at 72 hours post-infection with HIV-1NL4-3 or mutants deficient in Vpu, Nef or
both Vpu and Nef.
Plasma membrane expression of CD28 on CD4+ T cells was decreased by infection with
wildtype (WT) HIV-1NL4-3 over the 72 hour experiment. The expression of CD28 was downmodulated by the expression of Vpu and Nef. BIT225 treatment of WT infected cells resulted
in a partial restoration of CD28 expression that was dependent on Vpu expression only. The
double deletion of Vpu and Nef resulted in restoration of CD28 expression to levels
comparable to unifected cells. BIT225 reduces Vpu-related PM CD28 downregulation as a
result of HIV-1 infection.
Figure 2. Plasma Membrane expression of CD80 or CD86 on MDM treated with 3 mM of
BIT225 at 72 hours post-infection with HIV-1NL4-3 or mutants deficient in Vpu, Nef or both
Vpu and Nef.
A. Plasma membrane expression of CD80 on MDM was decreased by infection with WT
HIV-1NL4-3 over the 72 hour experiment. The PM expression of CD80 was modulated by the
expression of Vpu and Nef. BIT225 treatment of WT infected cells resulted in a partial
restoration of PM CD80 expression. The double deletion of Vpu and Nef resulted in
restoration of CD80 expression to levels comparable to uninfected cells. The BIT225
treatment response was dependent on Vpu expression.
B. Plasma membrane expression of CD86 on MDM was decreased by infection with WT
HIV-1NL4-3 over the 72 hour experiment. The PM expression of CD86 was modulated by the
expression of Vpu and Nef. BIT225 treatment of WT infected cells resulted in a partial
restoration of PM CD86 expression. The double deletion of Vpu and Nef resulted in
restoration of CD86 expression to levels comparable to uninfected cells. Unlike for the other
receptors, the CD86 BIT225 treatment response was similar in the viruses with Vpu or Nef
single deletions, implying a novel mechanism that is largely independent of Vpu expression.

BIT225 treatment increases PM expression of
CCR7. This may in part reestablish the
appropriate migration and homing to
anatomical sites in the body of the
CCR7+/CD4+T cells. This may result in more
efficient recognition and elimination of HIV-1
infected cells.

CONCLUSIONS
BIT225 is a clinical stage Vpu inhibitor, the first in class. A phase II study demonstrated safety and
tolerability, as well as the expected viral suppression in those treated with ART alone or ART plus
BIT225. Those in the BIT225 arm had a persistent elevation of activated CD4 cells, which has
prompted further study, including the data presented here. These data suggest that BIT225 treatment
can counteract Vpu-mediated downregulation of membrane expressed CD28 & CCR7 on CD4+ T cells,
as well as CD80 & CD86 on monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) infected with HIV-1. The
mechanism of action of BIT225 requires the presence of Vpu for modulation, and restoration of CD28
& CCR7 on CD4+ T cells, and CD80 on MDM. BIT225 treatment-related enhancement of CD86
expression on MDMs infected with the Vpu- mutant virus indicates that an additional mechanism of
BIT225 action operates in MDM. BIT225 thus appears to enhance the costimulatory, signal 2, of TCR
activation by increasing expression of both the receptor, and ligand on CD4+ T cells and MDM,
respectively. These findings, and those of enhanced homing indicate novel attributes of BIT225 Vpu
inhibition that suggest enhanced host immune surveillance of HIV. In the clinical trial enhanced CD4
activation, seen only in the BIT225 treated group, was persistent, even in the setting of rapidly falling
HIV RNA. Further studies will explore the hypothesis that Vpu inhibition permits the detection
of virus-infected cells that were neither eradicated by suppressive ART, nor readily identified by the
host immune system.
BIT225 treatment may be a valuable addition to future
antiretroviral treatment, and in consideration of eradication strategies.
