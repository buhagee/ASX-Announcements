The results confirm and extend the near surface, high-grade gold
mineralisation where it remains open to the southeast

•

Diamond drilling is underway to test the depth extent of the Starlight lode
below 200 vertical metres

Musgrave Minerals Ltd (ASX: MGV) (“Musgrave” or “the Company”) is pleased to report assay results
for a further eight reverse circulation (“RC”) drill holes from the current program at the new Starlight
gold discovery at Break of Day. Drilling continues to confirm the Starlight discovery and the strong
near surface high-grades in multiple individual lodes. Starlight remains open to the south-east and
down dip where drilling is continuing. All intercepts reported in the current drilling program are outside
the existing Break of Day resource estimate.
The Starlight lode at Break of Day is located on the Company’s 100% owned ground at its flagship
Cue Gold Project in Western Australia’s Murchison district (Figure 1). Drilling at Starlight is continuing,
with a focus on infilling and extending the high-grade gold mineralisation intersected to date. Drilling
will also continue to test for new lodes within the Break of Day and Lena system following the
discovery of the new White Light lode located 75m south of Starlight (see MGV ASX release dated 29
June 2020, “New gold lode discovered 75m south of Starlight”).

Musgrave Managing Director Rob Waugh said: “Starlight continues to produce stunning gold results
in near surface drilling. Further RC drilling is underway to infill and extend the Starlight
mineralisation with the aim of completing a JORC resource update late in Q3 2020. Drilling is
continuing with two rigs on site and we are confident we can extend Starlight and the new White
Light lode and make significant new discoveries in the belt.”

For personal use only

To date a total of 45 RC holes of a
planned 59 holes have been completed
with assay results received for 39
holes. Three diamond drill hole tails and
one twin hole have been completed to
date with assays pending. All new
assay results are shown in Table 1a
with further assays expected within two
weeks.
The
Starlight
and White
Light
mineralised gold lodes lie proximal to
the existing Break of Day resource
(Figure 2) within separate southeastnorthwest parallel mineralised zones
approximately 75m apart. Significantly,
all the intersections returned from
Starlight and White Light sit outside the
current resource at Break of Day.
The mineralisation consists of quartz
lodes hosted within a foliated and
altered basaltic stratigraphic sequence
that typically dip steeply to the south
(Figure 3). Both lodes have a strike
extent of over 100m and are open to
the south-east (Figures 3 & 5) and
down plunge.

Discussion of Results

A combination of six metre composites and one metre individual samples have been analysed from
the RC holes drilled in the current program with details defined in Tables 1a and 1b. All 6m
composite samples above 0.1g/t Au will be re-submitted for individual 1m sample analysis.

THE CUE PROJECT
The Cue Project (“the Project”) is
located in the Murchison district of
Western Australia (Figure 6) and hosts
Mineral Resources (Indicated and
Inferred) totalling 6.45Mt @ 3.0g/t gold
for 613,000oz contained gold. The
Company has defined a +28km-long
prospective gold corridor that includes
the Break of Day-Starlight, Lake Austin
North and Mainland-Consols gold
discoveries.
The Company believes there is
significant potential to extend existing
mineralisation and discover new gold
deposits within the Project area, as
demonstrated by the recent drilling
success at Break of Day, Lena and
Lake Austin North. Musgrave’s intent is
to investigate options to best develop a
low-cost
operation,
capable
of
delivering strong financial returns for its
shareholders.

Musgrave has executed an $18 million
Earn-in and Exploration Joint Venture
Figure 6: Cue Project location plan and tenure
with Evolution Mining Ltd over the Lake
Austin portion of the Cue Project
(Figure 6). The Break of Day, Lena and Mainland areas are excluded from the Earn-in and
Exploration Joint Venture with Evolution Mining Ltd.

Cyprium Australia Pty Ltd (“Cyprium”) has met the expenditure requirement to earn their 80%
interest in the non-gold rights over the northern tenure at Cue including the Hollandaire deposit
(Figure 6). Musgrave will retain 100% of the gold rights and a 20% free-carried interest in the nongold rights to the completion of a definitive feasibility study.

Criteria
Sampling techniques

Explanation
Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of
sampling.

Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report. In cases where ‘industry
standard’ work has been done this would be relatively
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to
obtain 1m samples from which 3kg was pulverised to
produce a 30g charge for fire assay’). In other cases
more explanation may be required, such as where there
is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems.
Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.

Commentary
Current RC drill program
RC samples are composited at 6m intervals using a stainless
steel scoop with all composite intervals over 0.1g/t Au
resampled at 1m intervals by cyclone splitter. Individual 1m
samples are submitted for initial assays where significant
obvious mineralisation is intersected.
Historical sampling criteria are unclear for pre 2009 drilling.
MGV sampling is undertaken using standard industry practices
including the use of duplicates and standards at regular
intervals.
All Reverse circulation (RC) samples are split to 1-3kg in weight
through a cyclone splitter on the drill rig for 1m drill intervals.
A Thermo Scientific Niton GoldD XL3+ 950 Analyser is available
on site to aid geological interpretation. No XRF results are
reported.
All co-ordinates are in UTM grid (GDA94 Z50) and drill hole
collars have been surveyed by GPS to an accuracy of 0.5m.
Current RC drill program
RC samples are composited at 6m intervals using a stainless
steel scoop with all intervals over 0.1g/t Au resampled at 1m
intervals by cyclone splitter. The 3kg samples are pulverised to
produce a 50g charge for fire assay with ICP-MS finish for gold.
Screen fire assay is undertaken on select high gold samples.
All one metre samples are split to 1-3kg in weight through a
cyclone splitter which is air blasted clean at the end of each 6m
rod. Individual samples weigh less than 3kg to ensure total
preparation at the laboratory pulverization stage.
The sample size is deemed appropriate for the grain size of the
material being sampled.
Samples are sent to the Genalysis – Intertek laboratory in
Maddington. Samples are pulverized to 85% passing -75um and
composite samples are analysed using a 50g fire assay with ICPMS (inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry) finish gold
analysis (0.005ppm detection limit).

Current RC drill program
RC drilling was used in this MGV program. Challenge Drilling Pty
Ltd utilised a KWL 350 drill rig with 1100/350 on-board
compressor with an Atlas Copco 1,000 cfm auxiliary, Hurricane
2,400cfm, 1,000 psi booster. Four inch RC drill rods with a 5.75”
face hammer were utilised. Down hole surveys were
undertaken at a maximum of 30m intervals using a north
seeking gyroscopic tool not subject to magnetic interference.
A total of more than 180 RC holes and 14 diamond drill holes
have been drilled by MGV at Break of Day & Lena.
Historically Silver Lake Resources Ltd (SLR) undertook RC drilling
at Break of Day and Lena between 2010 and 2013 with a
number of companies intermittently drilling prior to 2009
including Perilya Mines Ltd (1991-2007).
A combination of historical RAB, aircore, RC and diamond
drilling has been utilised by multiple companies over a thirty
year period across the broader project area.
Current RC drill program
RC 6m composite samples are collected and re-assayed at 1m
intervals were comps are above 0.1g/t Au. Sample weights,
dryness and recoveries are observed and noted in a field
Toughbook computer by MGV field staff.
MGV contracted drillers use industry appropriate methods to
maximise sample recovery and minimise downhole
contamination including using compressed air to maintain a dry
sample in RC drilling. A cyclone splitter was utilised to split 13kg of sample by weight. The splitter is air blasted clean at the
end of each 6m rod.
Historical sampling recovery is unclear for pre 2009 drilling.
No significant sample loss or bias has been noted in current
drilling or in the historical reports or from other MGV drill
campaigns.
All geological, structural and alteration related observations are
stored in the database.
Logging of lithology, structure, alteration, mineralisation,
weathering, colour and other features of core or RC/aircore
chips is undertaken on a routine 1m basis or on geological
intervals for diamond core.
All drill holes are logged in full on completion.
No diamond drilling has yet commenced at Starlight
RC samples are composited at 4m or 6m intervals using a
stainless steel scoop with all intervals over 0.1g/t Au resampled
at 1m cyclone split intervals.
Drill sample preparation and precious metal analysis is
undertaken by a registered laboratory (Genalysis – Intertek).
Sample preparation by dry pulverisation to 85% passing 75
micron.
MGV field QC procedures involve the use of certified reference
standards (1:50), duplicates (~1:30) and blanks at appropriate
intervals for early stage exploration programs. High, medium
and low gold standards are used.
Historical QA/QC procedures are unclear for pre 2009 drilling.
Sampling is carried out using standard protocols and QAQC
procedures as per industry practice.
Duplicate samples are inserted (~1:30) and more frequently
when in high-grade gold veins, and routinely checked against
originals. Duplicate sampling criteria is unclear for historical pre
2009 drilling.
Historical QA/QC procedures are unclear for pre 2009 drilling.
Sample sizes are considered appropriate for grain size of sample
material to give an accurate indication of gold mineralisation.
Samples are collected from full width of sample interval to
ensure it is representative of sample lithology.

On composite RC samples and 1m cyclone split samples,
analysis is undertaken by Intertek-Genalysis (a registered
laboratory), with 50g fire assay with ICP-MS finish undertaken
for gold. A screen fire re-assay is undertaken on select highgrade gold samples. This is also the technique used for sampling
of diamond core.
Internal certified laboratory QAQC is undertaken including
check samples, blanks and internal standards.
This methodology is considered appropriate for base metal
mineralisation and gold at the exploration phase.
In diamond core individual samples are analysed through
potential gold mineralised zones. Analysis is by 50g fire assay
with ICP-MS finish for gold.
No geophysical tools were used to estimate mineral or element
percentages. Musgrave utilise a Thermo Scientific Niton GoldD
XL3+ 950 Analyser to aid geological interpretation.
MGV field QC procedures involve the use of certified reference
standards (1:50), duplicates (~1:30) and blanks (1:50) at
appropriate intervals for early stage exploration programs.
Historical QA/QC procedures are unclear for pre 2009 drilling.
MGV samples are verified by the geologist before importing
into the main MGV database (Datashed).
No twin holes have been drilled by Musgrave Minerals Ltd
during this program.
Primary data is collected using a standard set of templates.
Geological sample logging is undertaken on one metre intervals
for all RC drilling with colour, structure, alteration and lithology
recorded for each interval. Data is verified before loading to the
database. Geological logging of all samples is undertaken.
No adjustments or calibrations are made to any assay data
reported.
All maps and locations are in UTM grid (GDA94 Z50) and have
been surveyed or measured by hand-held GPS with an accuracy
of >±5 metres.
Down hole surveys are undertaken using the axis digital
clinometer and gyroscope down hole tool in either continuous
reading mode or at regular 30m intervals.
Drill hole and sample site co-ordinates are in UTM grid (GDA94
Z50) and historical drill holes are converted from local grid
references.
All current and historical drill hole collars and RL’s are surveyed
by qualified surveyors in most instances in the resource areas
post drilling. Differential GPS is used to survey drill hole collars
pre-drilling with an accuracy of +-0.01 metre including RL’s. Drill
hole collars are planned and set up using standard GPS
(accuracy +-2m).
Variable drill hole spacings are used to adequately test targets
and are determined from geochemical, geophysical and
geological data together with historical drilling information.
At Starlight, a 20-50m spaced drill plan is used for the 3
dimensional pierce point projection with mineralisation with RC
drilling in the top 200m. Drill hole spacings are generally
variable and dependent on geology, continuity, resource status
and geological understanding and confidence.
At Lena a general pattern of approximately 25-75m drill
spacings on 25m spaced sections has been completed through
multiple phases over many years.
Historical drill hole spacings at Break of Day and Lena are
variable although Perilya, SLR and MGV drilled a number of
holes at approximately 12.5m, 25m or 50m sections from 19912019.
There is a current JORC 2012 Mineral Resource at Break of Day
and Lena defined by Musgrave Minerals Ltd.
The Mineral Resources estimate at Break of Day and Lena was
prepared and disclosed in accordance with the 2012 Edition of
the Australian Code of Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore
Reserves (JORC 2012).
For further details refer to MGV ASX announcement 14 July
2017, “Resource Estimate Exceeds 350koz Au” and 17 February
2020, “Lena Mineral Resource more than doubles and gold
grade increases”.

Six metre sample compositing has also been undertaken using a
stainless steel scoop for all RC drill holes in the current program.
Composite sampling is undertaken using a stainless steel spear
(trowel) at one metre samples and combined in a calico bag.
Where composite assays are above 0.1g/t Au, individual 1m
samples are submitted for gold assay. One metre individual
samples may be submitted without composites in certain
intervals of visibly favourable gold geology.
Historical QA/QC procedures are unclear for pre 2009 drilling.
Drilling is designed to cross the mineralisation as close to
perpendicular as possible on current interpretation whilst
allowing for some minor access restrictions and mitigating
safety risks.
Most drill holes are designed at a dip of approximately -60
degrees. The mineralisation at Starlight is interpreted to dip
between 50-85 degrees to the south. The true width of drill
intersections at Starlight are interpreted to be between 50-70%
of the drill intersection width.
No orientation based sampling bias is known at this time.

Chain of custody is managed by MGV internal staff. Drill
samples are stored on site and transported by a licenced
reputable transport company to a registered laboratory in Perth
(Genalysis-Intertek at Maddington). When at the laboratory
samples are stored in a locked yard before being processed and
tracked through preparation and analysis (Lab-Trak system).
During the resource estimates an external review of the
geological interpretation, data and modelling techniques was
undertaken by the resource consultant.

Commentary
Musgrave Minerals secured 100% of the Moyagee Project area
in August 2017 (see MGV ASX announcement 2 August 2017:
“Musgrave Secures 100% of Key Cue Tenure”) from Silver Lake
Resources Ltd.
The Break of Day, Starlight and Lena prospects are located on
granted mining lease M21/106 and the primary tenement
holder is Musgrave Minerals Ltd.
The Cue project tenements consist of 38 licences.
The tenements are subject to standard Native Title heritage
agreements and state royalties. Third party royalties are present
on some individual tenements.
The Mainland prospects are on tenements P21/731, 732, 735,
736, 737, 739, 741 where MGV has an option to acquire 100%
of the basement gold rights on the tenements (not part of the
EVN JV).
A new Earn-in and Exploration Joint Venture was executed with
Evolution Mining Ltd on 16 September 2019 covering Lake
Austin and some surrounding tenure but excludes all existing
resources including Break of Day and Lena (see MGV ASX
release dated 17 September 2019, “Musgrave and Evolution sign
an $18 million Earn-in JV and $1.5 million placement to
accelerate exploration at Cue”) and the new Mainland option
area.
The tenements are in good standing and no known
impediments exist.
Historical drilling, soil sampling and geophysical surveys have
been undertaken in different areas on the tenements
intermittently by multiple third parties over a period of more
than 30 years.
At Break of Day, Lena and Mainland historical exploration and
drilling has been undertaken by a number of companies and at
Break of Day and Lena most recently by Silver Lake Resources
Ltd in 2009-13 and prior to that by Perilya Mines Ltd form 19912007. Musgrave Minerals has undertaken exploration since
2016.

Geology comprises typical Archaean Yilgarn greenstone belt
lithologies and granitic intrusives.
Two main styles of mineralisation are present, typical Yilgarn
Archaean lode gold and volcanic massive sulphide (VMS) base
metal and gold mineralisation within the Eelya Felsic Complex.
All RC drill holes collars with assays received for the current drill
program at Starlight are reported in this announcement.
All relevant historical drill hole information has previously been
reported by Perilya, Silver Lake Resources, MGV and various
other companies over the years.

Significant assay intervals are recorded above 1g/t Au with a
minimum internal interval dilution of 2m @ 0.5g/t Au. No cutoff has been applied to any sampling.

Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths
of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade
results, the procedure used for such aggregation should
be stated and some typical examples of such
aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.
These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to
the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be
reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole
collar locations and appropriate sectional views.

No cut-off has been applied to any sampling. Reported intervals
are aggregated using individual assays above 1g/t Au with no
more than 2m of internal dilution <0.5g/t Au for any interval.
Short high-grade intervals are tabulated in Table 1a.

Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of
both low and high grades and/or widths should be
practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material,
should be reported including (but not limited to):
geological observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests
for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale
step-out drilling).

No metal equivalent values have been reported.
True widths are not confirmed but all drilling is planned close to
perpendicular to interpreted targets.
