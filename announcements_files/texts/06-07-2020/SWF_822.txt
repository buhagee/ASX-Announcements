Melbourne, Australia – 6th July 2020: SelfWealth Ltd (ASX: SWF) ("SelfWealth" or "the Company"), has
released its fourth FY20 Quarterly Cash Flow and Activities Report. This report shows further evidence of large
numbers of new clients joining SelfWealth's retail trading platform and establishing their investment portfolios
which in turn has led to a significant increase in operating revenue for the Company.
SelfWealth's Managing Director, Mr Rob Edgley had this to say on the quarterly results, "Key structural changes
that have been emerging over time in investment markets have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic,
leading to changes in investor behaviour. Ultra-low interest rates globally and the digitisation of investment
markets have led to large numbers of new investors in the share market, particularly amongst the Millennial
and Gen Y demographic. A generation of savers is being transformed into a generation of investors, providing
a sharp increase in the addressable market for SelfWealth's retail trading platform. This is evidenced by an
additional 14,132 'active traders' joining our platform in the past three months.
"It is very pleasing to see this increase in 'active traders' which has led to six consecutive record months in
trade volumes during the first half of 2020, and a more than doubling of total trades quarter-on-quarter. The
tailwinds assisting the online broking industry as a whole have been particularly prevalent in SelfWealth's case.

with each month contributing positive cash flow numbers -- in particular the month of June which was aided

Quarterly Activities Report - Q4 Financial Year 2020

The strong rally in share markets over the quarter combined with the influx of new clients has seen a
significant increase in the total securities held on HIN on the platform. The end of June total securities held
on HIN rose to $2.52bn, up from $1.56bn.

For personal use only

70% of the total orders filled on the platform during the quarter were on the 'buy' side as investors put their
money to work in the market. Despite this large percentage of buy transactions, the total client cash held on
the platform increased to $366m.

Product and Technology Update

The SelfWealth project team is working hard with our partner Phillip Capital to prepare the technology required
for the launch of US equity trading in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. The project is progressing
according to plan, and we hope to be able to invite all SelfWealth customers to open a US trading account
within their existing SelfWealth membership over the next few months in the lead up to the launch later in the
year.

An additional project to deliver an entirely new SelfWealth mobile app for iOS and Android, which aims to be a
market leader in design and usability, has begun and is expected to be delivered in the coming months. The app
will improve the trading experience for existing SelfWealth clients and attract new clients, especially in the
younger demographic.

Operating Cash Flow

As expected, with a substantial increase in new clients, quarterly revenue grew strongly, and the balance sheet
of the Company improved further. As of June 30, the Company has a net cash position of $XXXm and no
outstanding debt.
The next quarter will see an increase in the Company's investment in growth and new revenue streams, most
notably supporting the development of the international trading product and refreshed mobile applications.
In accordance with Listing Rule 4.7C, payments made to related parties and their associates included in items
6.1 of the Appendix 4C incorporates directors fees, remuneration and superannuation at commercial rates.
