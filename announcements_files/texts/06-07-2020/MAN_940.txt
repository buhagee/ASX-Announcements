Highlights
•

First analysis for platinum group elements (PGEs) confirms Newleyine
as another Ni-Cu-PGE enriched ultramafic intrusive, located 30km from
Chalice’s (ASX:CHN) exciting Julimar discovery

•

Surface rock chip results up to 0.36g/t Pd, 0.27g/t Pt, 0.5% Ni and 0.19%
Cu confirm Newleyine is highly fertile for Julimar-style mineralisation

•

Historic drilling at Newleyine has already confirmed widespread NiCu-Fe sulphide mineralisation grading 0.24% Ni and 172 ppm Cu over
drill widths of up to 240m

•

Newleyine had never previously been assessed for PGEs

•

Results expected for a further 52 rock chip samples in coming fortnight

•

Planned electromagnetic surveys to guide drill targeting

Mandrake Managing Director James Allchurch commented:
“The Julimar discovery has uncovered a previously unrecognised Ni-Cu-PGE
province on the doorstep of Perth and Mandrake’s recent surface results
demonstrate the potential for a similar mineralisation style at Newleyine.
“Our confidence in Newleyine has grown and given us added impetus to
proceed to the next step in our exploration approach. We will now commence
planning of electromagnetic geophysical surveys to identify drill targets within the
ultramafic rocks hosting this distinctive Ni-Cu-PGE metal signature”

Mandrake Resources Limited (ASX: MAN) (Mandrake or the Company) is pleased
to announce the results of the first batch of rock chip samples collected at the
Company’s Newleyine prospect in the Jimperding Metamorphic Belt located
70km north east of Perth, Western Australia.
The Newleyine prospect lies approximately 30km east of Chalice Gold Mines
Limited’s Julimar Ni-Cu-PGE discovery.
Mandrake has now completed a detailed mapping and rock chip sampling
programme involving the collection of a total of 96 rock chip samples from the
Newleyine prospect. Results from the first 44 rock chip samples collected are
detailed below and in Table 1 and Figures 1, 2 and 3.

Platinum and Palladium Results
Concentrations of platinum and palladium in the first batch of rock chip samples (NRX1–
NRX44) have exceeded expectations with rock chip samples up to 0.36g/t Pd and 0.27g/t
Pt (NRX024) confirming the ultramafic intrusive at Newleyine is highly fertile for platinum
group elements (PGEs).
Pt and/or Pd concentrations exceed 0.1g/t in seven rock chip samples across the area,
with PGE mineralisation contained almost exclusively within weathered ultramafic rocks.
This is an exciting development for the Company and has elevated Newleyine’s
prospectivity for PGEs given it is hosted in the same geological setting as Chalice’s Julimar.
The first field programme (NRX1 – NRX44) was designed to characterise the various rock
and regolith types at Newleyine with the second programme focusing more on mapping
and sampling of the prospective ultramafic rocks.
A further 52 rock chip samples were collected in the second programme at Newleyine with
results to be released in the coming weeks.

Nickel and Copper Results
Consistent with historic drill results and surface geochemistry previously announced, recent
sampling has confirmed the Newleyine prospect has discernable nickel and copper at
surface (note previous workers did not assay for PGEs).
Surface concentrations exceeding 0.1% nickel were recorded in 14 samples across
Newleyine with grades up to 0.5% Ni (NRX009) in a serpentinised dunite.
Copper results were broadly anomalous across Newleyine with concentrations up to 0.19%
Cu (NRX005).

The presence and relative concentrations of nickel and copper are consistent with
expectations and further enhance the prospectivity of Newleyine.
It is important to note that historic drilling at Newleyine confirmed the presence of
widespread Ni-Cu-Fe sulphide mineralisation of 0.24% Ni and 172 ppm Cu over drill widths
of up to 240m. (see Mandrake ASX release 14 April 2020). Again, samples were not assayed
for PGEs.

Plate 2 – Looking NW towards outcropping area in the west of the Newleyine prospect

Forthcoming Work
Surface concentrations of PGEs have elevated the prospectivity of Newleyine and
provided impetus to fast-track exploration.
Rock chip samples from outcrop and sub-crop were primarily collected from the
topographic high in the west of the Newleyine anomaly (see Figure 1, 2 and 3).
The eastern half of Newleyine comprises two paddocks with little to no outcrop however
ultramafic float and sub-crop was observed. This lower lying area incorporates distinct
magnetic highs that are not readily explained by the presence of BIF and may be related
to deeply weathered “blind” ultramafic units, never previously tested.
Following receipt and interpretation of rock chip results from the second programme,
Mandrake will likely undertake one or more electromagnetic surveys (EM) with a view to
identifying EM conductors for drill testing.

handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not

• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this
would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling
was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In
other cases more explanation may be required, such as
where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.
• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample

• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis
that the information is not Material and this exclusion does
not detract from the understanding of the report, the
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the
case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations
(eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually
Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of
high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results,
the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated
and some typical examples of such aggregations should
be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.
• These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect
(eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported These should include,
but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar
locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is
not practicable, representative reporting of both low and

misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should
be reported including (but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical

• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible

and future drilling areas, provided this information is not
commercially sensitive.
