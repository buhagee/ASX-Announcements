This presentation has been prepared as a summary only and does not contain all information
about ioneer Ltd’s (ioneer or the Company) assets and liabilities, financial position and
performance, profits and losses, prospects, and the rights and liabilities attaching to ioneer’s
securities. The securities issued by ioneer are considered speculative and there is no guarantee
that they will make a return on the capital invested, that dividends will be paid on the shares or
that there will be an increase in the value of the shares in the future.
ioneer does not purport to give financial or investment advice. No account has been taken of the
objectives, financial situation or needs of any recipient of this presentation. Recipients of this
presentation should carefully consider whether the securities issued by ioneer are an appropriate
investment for them in light of their personal circumstances, including their financial and taxation
position. Investors should make and rely upon their own enquiries before deciding to acquire or
deal in the Company's securities.
Forward Looking Statements
Various statements in this presentation constitute statements relating to intentions, future acts
and events which are generally classified as “forward looking statements”. These forward looking
statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance and involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors (many of which are beyond the
Company’s control) that could cause those future acts, events and circumstances to differ
materially from what is presented or implicitly portrayed in this presentation.
For example, future reserves described in this presentation may be based, in part, on market
prices that may vary significantly from current levels. These variations may materially affect the
timing or feasibility of particular developments.
Words such as “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “seeks”, “estimates”,
“potential” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
ioneer cautions security holders and prospective security holders to not place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which reflect the view of ioneer only as of the date of this
presentation.
The forward-looking statements made in this presentation relate only to events as of the date on
which the statements are made. Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, ioneer
does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on
as a guide to future performance.

Competent Persons Statement
In respect of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves referred to in this presentation and previously
reported by the Company in accordance with JORC Code 2012, the Company confirms that it is not
aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the
public report titled “Rhyolite Ridge Ore Reserve Increased 280% to 60 million tonnes” dated 30
April 2020 and released on ASX. Further information regarding the Mineral Resource estimate can
be found in that report. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the
estimates in the report continue to apply and have not materially changed.
In respect of production targets referred to in this presentation, the Company confirms that it is
not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the
public report titled “ioneer Delivers Definitive Feasibility that Confirms Rhyolite Ridge as a WorldClass Lithium and Boron Project” dated 30 April 2020. Further information regarding the
production estimates can be found in that report. All material assumptions and technical
parameters underpinning the estimates in the report continue to apply and have not materially
changed.
No offer of securities
Nothing in this presentation should be construed as either an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
offer to buy or sell ioneer securities in any jurisdiction or be treated or relied upon as a
recommendation or advice by ioneer.
Reliance on third party information
The views expressed in this presentation contain information that has been derived from publicly
available sources that have not been independently verified. No representation or warranty is
made as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information. This presentation should
not be relied upon as a recommendation or forecast by ioneer.
Lithium Carbonate Equivalent
The formula used for the Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) values quoted in this presentation is:
LCE = (lithium carbonate tonnes produced + lithium hydroxide tonnes produced * 0.880
Note
All $’s in this presentation are US$’s except where otherwise noted.

• The column in green represents the total cost to produce 1 tonne of LCE and ~9 tonnes of boric acid
LCE revenue is higher than the assumed lithium price due to conversion of LiOH to LCE by approximately 10%

• Rhyolite Ridge’s location in Nevada is another key difference
that sets the project apart
• Nevada is a first rate, low risk, mining friendly jurisdiction
with a long history of mining
• Well-established infrastructure and labour force
• Proximity to the Pacific coast strategically positions the
Project for entrance into major U.S. and Asian end markets
• Potential customers include Tesla, whose Gigafactory is
located ~200 miles away
• In 2019, U.S. total demand from lithium ion batteries was
42,000 tonnes of LCE
• By 2024 demand is estimated to be ~107,000 tonnes of LCE
from the current announced production
• U.S total demand is estimated to be 344,000 tonnes of LCE to
meet the current plans of U.S auto OEM’s by 2025.
