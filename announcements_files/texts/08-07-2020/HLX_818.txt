Closure of Entitlement Offer
Helix Resources Limited (ASX:HLX) (Helix or the Company) is pleased to announce that the pro-rata nonrenounceable rights issue of 1 New Share for every 2 Shares has closed heavily oversubscribed.
The Entitlement Offer sought to raise approximately $1.85m through the issue of shares at $0.007, with
the Company receiving strong interest from existing shareholders taking up their entitlement and
subscribing for additional shares through the Top Up facility in excess of the $1.85m being raised.
The Company received valid applications from over 560 eligible shareholders for over $3m of New Shares
under both the Entitlement Offer and the Top Up facility.
All eligible shareholders will be allocated their original requested entitlement amount, with Top Up amounts
to be allocated at the Board’s discretion.
The issue of New Shares under the Entitlement Offer is expected to occur on Friday, 10 July 2020 and
ASX trading of the New Shares is expected to commence on Monday, 13 July 2020.
Commenting on the success of the capital raising, Executive Chairman Mr Peter Lester said ‘We are
extremely pleased with the support shown from our shareholders, which has seen our $1.85 million capital
raising closed oversubscribed. The funds raised from this successful entitlement offer will allow us to
commence significant additional work on the Cobar gold project, advance studies at the Collerina copper
project, and have sufficient funds to effectively manage the Company’s activities.
An appendix 2A will follow.

This ASX release was authorised by the Helix Board.
