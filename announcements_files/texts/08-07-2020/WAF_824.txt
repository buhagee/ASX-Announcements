IMPORTANT NOTICE

For personal use only

IMPORTANT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER
This presentation contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of securities legislation, including information
relating to West African's future financial or operating performance. All statements in this presentation, other than statements
of historical fact, that address events or developments that West African expects to occur, are “forward-looking statements”.
Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the
words “expects”, “does not expect”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “does not anticipate”, “believes”, “intends”, “estimates”,
“projects”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “forecast”, “budget” and similar expressions, or that events or conditions “will”, “would”,
“may”, “could”, “should” or “might” occur. All such forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of the
relevant management as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risk factors and uncertainties,
many of which are beyond West African’s ability to control or predict. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on
estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may
cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements. In the case of West African, these statements include statements regarding annual gold
production forecasts, all of the results of the feasibility study, including estimates of internal rates of return, net present value,
future production, estimates of cash cost, assumed long term price for gold, proposed mining plans and methods, mine life
estimates, cash flow forecasts, metal recoveries, and estimates of capital and operating costs, their anticipated operations in
future periods, planned exploration and development of its properties, and plans related to its business and other matters that
may occur in the future. This information relates to analyses and other information that is based on expectations of future
performance and planned work programs. Statements concerning mineral resource and ore reserve estimates are also
considered forward-looking information as the estimation involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. Mineral
resource and/or ore reserve estimates may have to be re-estimated based on, among other things: fluctuations in the gold
price; results of future exploration activities; results of metallurgical testing and other studies; changes to proposed mining
operations, including dilution; and the possible failure to receive required permits, approvals and licenses.
Forward-looking information is subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could
cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking information, including, without
limitation: exploration hazards and risks; risks related to exploration and development of natural resource properties;
uncertainty in West African’s ability to obtain funding; gold price fluctuations; recent market events and conditions; risks
related to the uncertainty of mineral resource calculations and the inclusion of inferred mineral resources in economic
estimation; risks related to governmental regulations; risks related to obtaining necessary licenses and permits; risks related to
their business being subject to environmental laws and regulations; risks related to their mineral properties being subject to
prior unregistered agreements, transfers, or claims and other defects in title; risks relating to competition from larger
companies with greater financial and technical resources; risks relating to the inability to meet financial obligations under
agreements to which they are a party; ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel; and risks related to their directors and
officers becoming associated with other natural resource companies which may give rise to conflicts of interests. This list is not
exhaustive of the factors that may affect West African’s forward-looking information. Should one or more of these risks and
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those
described in the forward-looking information.
West African’s forward-looking information is based on the reasonable beliefs, expectations and opinions of their respective
management on the date the statements are made and West African does not assume any obligation to update forward
looking information if circumstances or management’s beliefs, expectations or opinions change, except as required by law. For
the reasons set forth above, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. For a complete
discussion with respect to West African, please refer to West African’s financial statements and related MD&A, all of which are
filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and available on West African’s website at www.westafricanresources.com.

Feasibility Study, Sanbrado Gold Project, Burkina Faso” and with an effective date of 25 March 2019. This technical report
includes relevant information regarding the effective dates and the assumptions, parameters and methods of the mineral
resource and reserve estimates on the Sanbrado Gold Project cited in this presentation, as well as information regarding data
verification, exploration procedures and other matters relevant to the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this
presentation.
Non IFRS Financial Performance Measures
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this presentation, including operating cash costs and all-in
sustaining costs ("AISC") per ounce of gold produced. These non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardised
meaning. Accordingly, these financial measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”). Operating cash costs and all-in-sustaining cash costs are a common financial performance measure in the
mining industry but have no standard definition under IFRS. Operating cash costs are reflective of the cost of production. AISC
include operating cash costs, net-smelter royalty, corporate costs, sustaining capital expenditure, sustaining exploration
expenditure and capitalised stripping costs. The Company also includes EBITDA in this presentation, which also has no standard
definition under IFRS. The Company calculates EBITDA as net profit or loss for the period excluding finance costs, income tax
expense and depreciation. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes and the effects of changes
in working capital balances and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as
determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

Note: Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this document may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. The Sanbrado Gold
Project Mineral Resources estimates have an effective date of 16 April 2019. For further details, please refer to the ASX announcement released by West African on 16 April 2019 entitled “West African
to produce +300,000 ounces gold in first year at Sanbrado”. Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of those Mineral Resources that have been modified to Mineral Ore Reserves. Mineral Resources that
are not Mineral Ore Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. All tonnage, grade and contained metal content estimates have been rounded; rounding may result in apparent summation
differences between tonnes, grade, and contained metal content.

Note: The Toega Gold Project Mineral Resources are qualifying foreign estimates under the ASX Listing Rules and are not reported in accordance
with the JORC Code. Competent persons have not done sufficient work to classify the qualifying foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in
accordance with the JORC Code. It is uncertain, that following evaluation and further exploration, the foreign estimates will be able to be reported as
Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC code. The financial metrics used to determine the reporting limits of the Mineral Resources were
compiled by B2 Gold and may not be applicable to West African Resources. The B2Gold financial assumptions should not be relied upon as they
were based on the assumptions made by B2Gold at the time they were reported and do not apply to WAF. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral
Ore Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. All tonnage, grade and contained metal content estimates have been rounded; rounding
may result in apparent summation differences between tonnes, grade, and contained metal content. For further details, please refer to the ASX
announcements released by West African on 29 April 2020 "WAF to Acquire 1.1Moz Toega Gold Deposit from B2Gold" and 1 May 2020 "Clarification
re Toega Gold Deposit".
