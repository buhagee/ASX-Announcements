UPDATE ON LANYON RECAPITALISATION PROPOSAL AND SECOND LETTER FROM RAMCAP
Further to the announcement made on 1 June 2020, 8IP Emerging Companies Limited (ASX: 8EC)
(Company) provides the following update regarding the agreement with Lanyon Asset Management
Pty Limited (Lanyon) (Lanyon Proposal).
On 26 May 2020, 8EC applied for in-principle advice from the ASX as to the suitability for its readmission to the Official List and application of Listing Rules 1.1 Condition 1 and 1.19. On 24 June
2020, the ASX advised the Company that based on the information provided by 8EC and the facts
known at that date, ASX is not aware of any reason that would cause 8EC not to have a structure and
operations suitable for a listed entity for the purposes of Listing Rule 1.1 Condition 1 or that which
would cause ASX to exercise its discretion to refuse admission to the Official List under Listing Rule
1.19.
Following receipt of this advice from the ASX, the draft Notice of Meeting relating to the Lanyon
Proposal has been completed and will be lodged with the ASX today for its review. This will be sent to
shareholders once it has been approved by the ASX.
New Letter from RAMCap Limited
8EC shareholders may have received in the mail recently a further letter from RAMCap Limited dated
29 June 2020 (RAMCap Second Proposal) (see attached copy). As was the case with the previous
letter, RAMCap has not sought to engage with the 8EC Board, and is understood not to hold any
shares in 8EC at the date of the letter.
The RAMCap Second Proposal, like its first proposal, still contains limited or nil information on key
issues relating to RAMCap such as corporate structure and ownership, financial information including
funding capacity, identity of key personnel and their backgrounds, investment track record etc. The
details relating to RAMCap’s plans for 8EC continue to be brief, raise many questions and in
particular, it is difficult to see how its proposal would result in significantly increased liquidity for all
8EC shareholders, which is a key principle for the 8EC Board when assessing the merits or otherwise
of alternative proposals.

Furthermore, the RAMCAP Second Proposal purports to include an offer to a very limited category of
8EC shareholders to acquire their shares at a price of 4.263 cents per share. This offer is only
available to shareholders holding at least 49,999 shares, on a first come first served basis and
RAMCap is apparently seeking to acquire a maximum of only 600,000 shares in total (which is
equivalent to approximately 1.46% of 8EC’s issued capital). This is unfair to those shareholders who
are excluded from being able to accept.
The 8EC Board considers that the RAMCap Second Proposal is not superior to the Lanyon Proposal
and therefore RECOMMENDS THAT 8EC SHAREHOLDERS TAKE NO FURTHER ACTION with respect to
the RAMCap Second Proposal.
The 8EC Board remains committed to implementing the Lanyon Proposal, in the absence of a
superior proposal, and looks forward to the meeting of shareholders at which the Lanyon Proposal
will be considered.
Shareholders will continue to be advised of any developments via ASX announcements.
This announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of 8EC.
