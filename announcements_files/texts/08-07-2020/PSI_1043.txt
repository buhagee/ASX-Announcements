PSC INSURANCE GROUP LTD (PSI) â€“ TRADING UPDATE
As part of our continuing effort to ensure the shareholders in PSI remain informed during this
unusual economic environment, we provide the following update.
Year to date Underlying EBITDA performance to the end of May 2020 was over 30% above the prior
comparative period and the May month was approximately 100% up on the prior comparative
period. June revenue has also been in line with expectations with great results from the core broking
and agency businesses. Consequently, we continue to remain committed to the AGM guidance for
the FY 2020, being an Underlying EBITDA of over $57m.
The achievements across the business in servicing our clients and building our customer base have
been outstanding and we have seen this period build strong foundations for a successful FY 2021.
The FY 2021 results will reflect the FY 2020 outcomes plus the annualisation of the Paragon
contribution, work undertaken during the last quarter of FY 2020 to tighten costs and we are
expecting strong organic growth following the bedding down of the significant acquisitions made in
FY 2020
Please direct any queries to Tony Robinson, Managing Director 0407 355 616.

Authorised for release to the ASX by the PSC Insurance Group Limited Board.
