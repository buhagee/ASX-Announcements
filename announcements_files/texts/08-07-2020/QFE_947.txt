QuickFee Limited (ASX:QFE) (“QuickFee”) is pleased to provide the following business update for the
quarter ended 30 June 2020 (Q4 FY20).

3rd consecutive quarter of record lending achieved in the US
For the quarter ended 30 June 2020, QuickFee’s lending activities remained strong amid the current
COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States (US) business delivering record growth in lending and the
Australian operations delivering an all-time lending record for the month of June.
In the US, lending of US$3.9 million in the June 2020 quarter represented an increase of 71% on the
previous corresponding period (pcp), being the June 2019 quarter. This 71% increase represents the
third consecutive quarter of record lending for QuickFee’s US operations. The US finished FY20 with
US$13.0 million in lending, up 63% on FY19.
Lending in Australia for Q4 FY20 was A$13.6 million, 1% on pcp. This modest increase reflects weaker
lending in late April and May as firms reduced invoicing during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown.
However, June lending reached an all-time monthly record of A$5.4 million. Overall, Australian
lending in FY20 increased 17% on the prior year to a record A$49.3 million.

The annualised payment portal transaction processing run rate is now US$554 million (June 2019:
US$174 million).

Strong new firm growth
QuickFee continues to gain traction in the US, with 88 new firms signed by QuickFee in Q4 FY20, up
300% compared to 22 new firm sign ups in the pcp. This included the signing in June of QuickFee’s
first “Top 10” US accounting firm – with revenue exceeding US$1bn – to the PayLater (payment plans
only) solution.
There are now 26 “Top 100” US accounting firms signed up. New firm signups are a leading indicator
of expected future growth.
The total number of firms signed up with QuickFee US as of 30 June 2020 was 412 (30 June 2019: 252).
Whilst the lending book continues to perform well with few issues, with the COVID-19 situation
creating continuing challenges, QuickFee will be determining the size of an increased general
provision for potentially unrecoverable receivables and will include such an amount in the FY20
financial statements. The amount is expected to be approximately 1% of loan receivables, reflective of
the quality of the structured lending product and minimal levels of bad debt being experienced across
the business in Australia and the US.

CEO’s commentary

For personal use only

Commenting on the June quarter, Bruce Coombes, CEO of QuickFee, said:

“

We continue to be very encouraged by the traction we are achieving in the US. The third
consecutive quarter of record lending reflects a very strong uptake of our product by US accounting and
law firms, and with continued growth in new firm sign-ups, we expect this momentum to accelerate.
Transactional volumes exploded in the US over the fourth quarter, with COVID-19 benefiting QuickFee by
forcing many firms and clients to embrace online payments. Our view is that this transition to online
payments will continue in the US, where until now online payments for accounting firms have not been
widely used. This represents an exciting area of growth for QuickFee as we look forward.

”

Outlook: new firm activations in the US and e-invoicing to drive further growth
The record growth achieved in the US, and the record year in Australia, means QuickFee heads into
FY21 with strong momentum. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 challenges many businesses are facing,
growth in new firm signings, new activations, and the growing adoption of online payments all
represent large tailwinds for QuickFee.
With growing acceptance of our lending products, a huge addressable market, significant numbers of
new firm signings and activations, our first mover advantage and the recent increase in our funding
capacity, directors believe QuickFee is extremely well placed to execute on a massive US growth
opportunity. We are still very early in our journey in the US, and we have a fantastic team and the
capability to service this growth.
Following the successful capital raise in May, QuickFee has now completed the recruitment of the key
engineering leads for the development of its core new technology. The build of our receivables
management system for the US market is underway and QuickFee expects to have its first US
customer using the e-invoicing and accounts receivable management system by the end of Q1 FY21.
Delivering the e-invoicing functionality will be a significant milestone for QuickFee and is expected to
drive additional take-up of QuickFee’s lending products. Based on the early feedback received to
date, QuickFee expects strong demand for its e-invoicing and receivables management system.
QuickFee is expected to release its full year financial results for the year ended 30 June 2020 in mid to
late August 2020.
This announcement has been authorised for release by the directors.
