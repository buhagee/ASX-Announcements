Black Cat Gains Control Over >45kms of the
Hampton-Victory Corridor
ASX Announcement
8 July 2020

For personal use only

Black Cat Syndicate Limited (“Black Cat” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that the
Company has entered into a Binding Sale and Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) to acquire 100%
of the Yarri East Project (“Yarri East”) to complement the Bulong Gold Project (“Bulong”).
HIGHLIGHTS
−

Yarri East to be acquired from a subsidiary of Newmont Corporation and RBR Group
Ltd.

−

Strategic and highly prospective landholding to expand by ~74% to 491km2.

−

Black Cat now the 5th largest landholder within 50km of Kalgoorlie.

−

Control of >45km over the underexplored Hampton and Victory Faults structural
corridor (“Hampton-Victory corridor”) extending from Bulong to the north and Fingals
to the south.

Figure 1: Largest landholders within 50km of Kalgoorlie. Black Cat’s holding is displayed in yellow post the Yarri East acquisition.

Black Cat’s Managing Director, Gareth Solly, said: “Yarri East directly adjoins our Bulong Gold
Project to the north. This acquisition creates an enviable and dominant land position covering over
45km of strike along the highly prospective Hampton-Victory corridor. The mineralised corridors at
Bulong to the north and Fingals to the south are both associated with this regional scale corridor.
Despite the proximity to Kalgoorlie, modern exploration is sparse along this corridor. Yarri East has
a number of existing anomalies that require follow up and also contains significant regional
opportunities. There is plenty of scope to apply our learnings from Bulong to Yarri East.”

ACQUISITION

For personal use only

Black Cat has expanded its landholding around Bulong by entering into an agreement to acquire
~210km2 of highly prospective ground immediately adjoining Bulong to the north. Strategically, this
acquisition creates an enviable and dominant position covering 45km of strike over the highly
prospective Hampton-Victory corridor. The mineralised corridors at Bulong and Fingals are both
associated with the regional scale Hampton and Victory Faults. This acquisition also increases Black
Cat’s total landholding to ~491km2. Within 50km of Kalgoorlie, Black Cat will be the 5th largest land
holder, behind Northern Star Resources (ASX:NST), Horizon Minerals (ASX:HRZ); Zijin Mining
Group (2899.HK) and Evolution Mining (ASX:EVN) – see Figure 1.
`

Yarri East (E27/600, E27/456,
E27/449, E27/431) 100%
Yarri East is located immediately
north of Bulong and contains
multiple areas of gold and nickel
anomalism along the regional
north-south
Hampton-Victory
Faults (Figure 2).
These
structures form part of a regional
trend that continues to the south
through Bulong and on to Black
Cat’s recently acquired Fingals
Gold Project.
Acquisition terms for Yarri East
include the following: cash
consideration of $200,000; 1%
Net Smelter Royalty; assignment
of
environmental
liabilities
(minimal)
and
obtaining
approvals
regarding
the
tenement transfers.

IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES

For personal use only

Black Cat will complete a prioritisation of its exploration opportunities during July 2020 and all targets
will be assessed and ranked. Priority targets within Yarri East include those discussed below.
Billabong – A 600m long gold and arsenic in soil anomaly was discovered in 1994. Subsequent
RAB and RC drilling delineated supergene gold along a prospective contact between differentiated
dolerite and foliated fine-grained sediments, within a favourable structural zone. Recent AC drilling
in 2019, by Newmont identified broad areas of anomalous gold and identified graphitic shales within
the sediment package, with gold focussed on the contact between the dolerite and the graphitic
shale. Billabong sits in a similar geological setting to the Penny’s Find deposit, which lies <2km to
the east, where 18,356 oz at 4.47 g/t Au were mined by open pit. Better results from historical drilling
at Billabong include 1:

−

4m @ 2.70 g/t Au from 10m (PR3);

−

2m @ 4.40 g/t Au from 34m (PRC1); and

−

2m @ 1.70 g/t Au from 16m (PRC1).

Muffler Hill – Located in the centre of the tenements, Muffler Hill is focussed around an area of high
grade historic shafts Multiple discrete lines of shafts on a NW orientation have been mapped with a
combined length of 1.2km, and cover an area around the contact between a fine grained basalt and
coarser grained dolerite. The high grade shafts were mined between 1903-1906 with grades at the
‘Blue Duck’ shaft up to 187 g/t Au. 2 There are >100 historic workings mapped on these prospective
structures. 3

Philomena – A multi-element soil anomaly covering a folded unit, with both limbs considered
prospective. Historic drilling has found elevated gold values associated with quartz stockwork veins,
at a lithological contact between a basalt and sheared ultramafic. Best results include: 4
−

2m @ 2.05 g/t Au from 38m (PMRC031); and

−

2m @ 6.00 g/t Au from 18m (PMRC034).

ABOUT BLACK CAT SYNDICATE (ASX:BC8)

For personal use only

With the completion of this acquisition, Black Cat will control 491km2 of highly prospective tenements
to the east of the world class mining centre of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The four main project
areas include:
−

Bulong Gold Project (“Bulong”), including Yarri East, now comprises ~350km² of land located
25-50km east of Kalgoorlie. The combined leases capture in excess of 45km of prospective
stratigraphic and structural targets with minimal modern exploration. Advanced deposits
undergoing mining studies along with early stage exploration opportunities exist throughout
the Project;

−

Fingals Gold Project (“Fingals”) comprises ~100km2 of land located ~30km south east of
Bulong. This area contains multiple recently mined Resources and extensive areas of historic
mining and limited modern exploration; and

−

Rowe’s Find Gold Project (“Rowe’s Find”) comprises ~41km2 of land located ~100km east of
Bulong. This project contains JORC 2004 Resources and drill ready targets on an overlooked
greenstone belt.

Bulong, Fingals and Rowe’s Find contain JORC 2004 and 2012 Mineral Resource Estimates
(“Resources”). Under the ASX reporting guidelines we can only quote the acquired JORC 2004
Resources once prior to re-releasing them under JORC 2012 with appropriate additional disclosures
and hence shareholders are referred to our ASX announcement dated 28 May 2020.
Existing infrastructure proximal to Bulong, Fingals and Rowe’s Find presents significant opportunities
for mining operations.

Appendix 1 - Summary of Historical Drilling Programs

For personal use only

Billabong was found by prospector Melville Dalla-Costa in 1994, the project was then sold to
Kanowna Consolidated Gold Mines in 1996, who then completed 19 vertical RAB holes for 884
meters with four angled RC holes 349 meters following up on significant hits . All holes were
targeting a gold in soil anomaly which trends with stratigraphy to the NW. All RC samples were
2m composites and RAB samples were initially sampled as 4m composites with selected 1m
resplits. All assays were by fire assay with an AAS finish. All assays >1 g/t are shown below with
no internal dilution.

Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria

JORC Code Explanation

Commentary

Sampling techniques

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random
chips, or specific specialised industry standard
measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or
handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample
representivity and the appropriate calibration of any
measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are
Material to the Public Report. In cases where ‘industry
standard’ work has been done this would be relatively
simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m
samples from which 3kg was pulverised to produce a 30g
charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may
be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has
inherent sampling problems.

Historic sampling activities at Yarri East have been undertaken via RAB, AC and RC drilling.

Drilling techniques

Drill sample recovery

Logging

Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine
nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer,
rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg
core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond
tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample
recoveries and results assessed.
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.
Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and
grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to
preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.
Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support
appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies
and metallurgical studies.

Recent AC undertaken by Newmont provides high quality representative samples that are carried out to industry
standard and include QAQC standards. Representivity of historic RC drilling was not documented.
Newmont’s recent AC drilling is sampled into 1m intervals via a cyclone on the rig producing a representative
sample of approximately 2.5kg. 4m composite sampling then occurred via the use of a spear. Samples are selected
to weigh less than 2.5kg to ensure total sample inclusion at the pulverisation stage.
All AC samples are crushed, dried and pulverised to a nominal 90% passing 75µm to produce a 40g or 50g sub
sample for analysis by FA/AAS.
Historic RC samples were prepared at a commercial laboratory using a single stage mix and grind and analysed
using fire assay with an AAS finish.

The AC rig utilised 89mm drill pipe with both AC blade and slim-line reverse-circulation hammer bits. RC drilling
size was not recorded.

Historic recoveries were not reported on.
AC sample recovery and representivity were checked through use of duplicate samples. RC recovery was not
reported. No known twinned holes were drilled.
There is no known bias between sample recovery and grade.

Logging of AC chips record lithology, mineralogy, texture and weathering.
Logging of RC chips record lithology and weathering.

Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature.

Specification of the grid system used.

Commentary
All recent drilling has been logged in full.
No sampling in this report.
All Newmont’s AC sampling to date has been done as 4m composites with a spear, from 1m increments collected
directly off the rig. RC sampling was completed as 2m comps with no method recorded.
The laboratory preparation of samples adheres to industry best practice. It is conducted by a commercial laboratory
and involves oven drying, coarse crushing then total grinding.
1m subsampling of composites was achieved by taking the 1m sample produced at the rig while drilling.
Newmont’s AC field duplicate samples are carried out at a rate of 1:50. These are submitted for the same assay
process as the original samples and the laboratory are unaware of such submissions. RC sampling duplicate
procedures were not reported.
Sample sizes of 2.5kg are considered to be appropriate.
Samples are analysed by an external laboratory using fire assay with AAS finish. This method is considered
suitable for determining gold concentrations in rock and is a total digest method.
For selected holes from the AC drilling, magnetic susceptibility data was gathered using a Fugro GMS-2m with
readings collected in SI units. Geochemical data was captured at the rig at 2m intervals using an Olympus VANTA
pXRF in lieu of laboratory analysis for multi element data. pXRF specific CRM and blacks were used at the start of
each hole.
AC drilling adhered to strict QAQC protocols involving collection of field duplicates and insertion of certified
reference material (blanks and standards). QAQC data are checked against reference limits. No QAQC information
was published for RC drilling.
The laboratories performed a number of internal processes including repeats, standards and blanks.
Significant intercepts from the AC drilling are verified by geological staff.
No twinned holes were reported.
All primary AC data related to geological and sample logs were captured digitally in Newmont’s proprietary logging
system and stored within a global exploration database.
No adjustments or calibrations are made to any assay data, apart from resetting below detection values to half
positive detection. First gold assay is utilised for exploration work.
For the AC drilling no down hole surveys were used, with holes sighted using a compass with no downhole
deviation assumed. RC drilling survey details were not reported on. No collar survey details were reported.
AC uses the grid system GDA 1994 MGA Zone 51. RC drilling was in a local grid.

JORC Code Explanation

Commentary

Quality and adequacy of topographic control.
Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to
establish the degree of geological and grade continuity
appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.

Topographical control was not reported on.
The nominal drill hole spacing is 400m (northing) by 60m (easting).
Drill hole spacing is not sufficient.

Whether sample compositing has been applied.

No compositing has been applied.

Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased
sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this
is known, considering the deposit type.

RC drilling is drilled towards grid east at -60 to intersect the mineralised zones at a close to perpendicular
relationship for the bulk of the deposits, AC drilling was to grid east or west, depending on deposit drilled .

If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the
orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to
have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed
and reported if material.
The measures taken to ensure sample security.

No orientation-based sampling bias has been identified in the data at this point.

The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques
and data.

AC samples are selected, collected into tied calico bags and delivered to the laboratory by staff or contractors
directly and there are no concerns with sample security.

Exploration Lease E27/431 is held until 2022 and is renewable for a further five years, then on a two year rolling
basis.
Exploration Lease E27/449 is held until 2022 and is renewable on a two year rolling basis.
Exploration Leases E27/456 and E27/600 are pending.
All production is subject to a Western Australian state government Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) royalty of 2.5%. As
additional 1% NSR royalty will be payable on production to the Seller.
There is one recorded Aboriginal Heritage site on E27/449 and no pastoral compensation agreements over the
tenements.

Commentary

The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along
with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to
operate in the area.

A timber reserve exists in the area and additional conditions are placed on operating within. The tenements are in
good standing.

Exploration done by other
parties

Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other
parties.

There has been historical mining and exploration carried out in the area since gold was discovered in 1903.
Modern exploration began in the 1980’s with Boulder Gold exploring for cobalt. A prospector then found gold at the
Billabong prospect in 1994 and the project was sold to Kanowna Consolidated gold mines who undertook soil and
auger sampling and RAB and AC drilling until 2001. Kanowna Consolidated gold mines explored for gold and
nickel. Little work was done until 2019 when Newmont followed up historical drilling with aircore, focussed mainly
on the gold prospectivity of the area.

Geology

Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.

The Yarri East Project is located in the Gindalbie Domain of the Kurnalpi Terrane of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton.
Project-scale geology consists of granite-greenstone lithologies that were metamorphosed to greenschist facies
grade. The Archaean lithologies are cut by Proterozoic dolerite dykes.
The style of mineralisation is Archaean orogenic gold.

Drill hole information

A summary of all information material to the understanding
of the exploration results including a tabulation of the
following information for all Material drill holes:

Locally the prospects are situated within lithogoval contacts.
Tables containing drill hole collar, survey and intersection data are included in the body of the announcement.

− easting and northing of the drill hole collar;
− elevation or Reduced Level (“RL”) (elevation above sea
level in metres) of the drill hole collar;
− dip and azimuth of the hole;
− down hole length and interception depth;
− hole length; and
− if the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis
that the information is not Material and this exclusion does
not detract from the understanding of the report, the
Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the
case.
Data aggregation methods

In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg
cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually
Material and should be stated.

All aggregated zones are length weighted.
No high grade cuts have been used.

Commentary

Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and
some typical examples of such aggregations should be
shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.

All intersections are calculated using a 0.5 g/t Au lower cut-off with maximum waste zones between grades of 1m,
except where stated in the body of the report.

These relationships are particularly important in the reporting
of Exploration Results.

All intercepts are reported as downhole depths as true widths are not yet determined.

Not applicable, as no metal equivalent values have been reported.

If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill
hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg
‘down hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations
of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery
being reported These should include, but not be limited to a
plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate
sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration.
Results are not practicable, representative reporting of both
low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious
or contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for
lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale stepout drilling).

Appropriate diagrams have been included in the body of the announcement.

All results have been tabulated in this release.

Geophysical surveys including aeromagnetic surveys have been carried out by previous owners to highlight and
interpret prospective structures in the project area.

Black Cat intends to continue to explore for gold and base metals on the Yarri East project.

Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible
extensions, including the main geological interpretations and
future drilling areas, provided this information is not
commercially sensitive
