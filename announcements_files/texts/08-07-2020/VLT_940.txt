Vault). Combined Information does not constitute a forecast, estimate, guidance, projection, prediction or indication of future performance, and should not be relied upon as such (or for any

November 2020 (subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set out in the scheme implementation deed separately released to the market). Therefore, if the Acquisition is completed,
Damstra’s financial results for FY21 will only include for the part of FY21 following completion of the Acquisition where Vault is under Damstra’s ownership.
