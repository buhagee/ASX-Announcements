Major shareholder Tolga Kumova to maintain significant shareholding

GTI Resources Ltd (GTI or the Company) refers to the Share Purchase Plan announced yesterday
on ASX. The Company advises that lead manager CPS Capital Group Pty Ltd (CPS) had capacity and
demand to raise the funds solely through the lead placement however the directors have elected
to provide the Company’s 2,000+ shareholders the chance to participate on the same terms via a
Share Purchase Plan (SPP) to raise $978,000 via the issue of 32,600,000 shares at an issue price of
3 cents per share, fully underwritten by CPS. The Board is also pleased to note that major
shareholder Mr Tolga Kumova has participated in the placement to maintain his significant
shareholding.
Given the significant works programs and anticipated shareholder value drivers over the coming
months the Company expects the underwritten SPP will be sufficient to achieve its ambitious work
programs in 2020.
The work programs encompass assets in both the US and Western Australia, drill targeting is
underway at the Niagara (Kookynie) Gold Project in W.A., located in close proximity to the
Metalicity Ltd and Nex Metals Exploration Ltd’s JV asset at Kookynie. In addition, the phase two
exploration program is being planned at the high grade Jeffrey project in Utah, where recent
drilling has confirmed the projected geometry of the mineralised trend.
There is no current operational requirement for the Board to accept additional funds to meet its
stated objectives above the underwritten amount, however the Directors reserve the right to
accept additional funds above the underwritten amount.
Full details of the offer will be contained in the SPP offer document booklet, with a hardcopy of the
offer document and acceptance form expected to be dispatched to Eligible Shareholders on
Monday, 13 July 2020.
