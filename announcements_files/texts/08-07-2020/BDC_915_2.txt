Key Points:
•

Firm commitments received for share placement to raise $24M.

•

Strongly supported by Tier-1 Australian and global institutions and strategic investors.

Proceeds from the placement will increase Bardoc’s cash reserves to over $35M, allowing it to
advance its North Kalgoorlie gold development strategy to the next level and substantially de-risking
its development pathway.

•

Key development activities include:
-

Completion and delivery of the Definitive Feasibility Study for the 3.02Moz Bardoc Gold Project
including development studies leveraging off the extensive feasibility work and metallurgical
test work already completed; and

-

Complete front-end engineering and design (FEED) work and secure key long-lead items ahead
of a Final Investment Decision (FID);

•

The placement will also underpin ongoing high-impact drilling programs across multiple newlyidentified exploration targets at the Bardoc Project with the potential to increase the Company’s
current 3.02Moz Resource.

•

Project-wide Mineral Resource update on track for completion by the end of Q3 2020.

•

DFS and FEED studies continue to make strong progress, together with permitting and approvals,
paving the way for a FID by end-Q2 2021.

This transformational capital raising, which has been strongly supported by a number of leading Australian
and international institutional and strategic investors, will increase its cash reserves to over $35 million,
putting it in a very strong position as it makes the transition from explorer to developer to producer.
Specifically, the funds raised will be used to fast-track the ongoing Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) and
mining studies for the 3.02Moz Bardoc Gold Project as well as accelerate exploration work across the
Company’s tenements with a view to further expanding and upgrading the existing Mineral Resource.
The additional funding will also facilitate an aggressive approach to unlocking the value of the Company’s
exploration and development pipeline outside of the existing mine plan, with stepped-up drilling programs
planned at the Company’s Mayday North, North Kanowna Star and Vettersburg (Slug Hill) Projects.
Bardoc Gold’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Robert Ryan, said the high level of demand from institutional
investors for the share placement reflected the strong appetite for advanced, high quality gold assets in
Australia at a time of continued record strength in the gold market.
“This is a landmark capital raising for the Company that will result in the introduction of a number
of Tier-1 institutional and strategic investors to our registers. These are investors who are willing
to follow their money and back us as we make the transition from explorer to developer to
producer over the next 12-18 months.
“The success of this raising reflects the growing level of recognition within the market that
Bardoc is one of the few advanced gold developers which is now ready to take the next step and
become one of the next mid-tier gold producers on the ASX.
“We see this next phase of activity as very much a continuation of the strategy we have been
pursuing over the past three years - with the three key elements comprising aggressive
exploration to grow our Resource base, selective and value-accretive acquisitions and mergers,
and the completion of high-quality development studies to progress the Bardoc Gold Project
towards production.
“As a result of this raising, Bardoc will have cash of more than $35 million, giving us the financial
capacity and flexibility to rapidly advance the next stage of our multi-pronged growth strategy
in the Kalgoorlie district.
“We are already well advanced towards achieving these goals as a result of the strong PreFeasibility study announced in March this year. Additionally, with activity levels now ramping up
across the Company, investors can look forward to strong upcoming news-flow including a
Mineral Resource update due later this quarter, regular updates on our DFS activities and, of
course, intensifying exploration activity.”

The new shares to be issued under the Placement will rank equally with the existing ordinary shares on
issue. The Placement will be undertaken within the Company’s existing placement capacity under the ASX
Listing Rules with 138.37 million shares to be issued under Listing Rule 7.1A and 169.32 million shares to be
issued under LR 7.1. Accordingly, no shareholder approval will be required for the issue of Placement
shares. Allotment of the shares pursuant to the Placement is expected to occur on or around 17th July 2020.
The Placement price of $0.078 per share represents:
•

A 13.3% discount to the closing price of the Company’s shares on 3rd July 2020, which was $0.090; and

•

A 9.1% discount to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) in respect of the last 5 trading days,
which was $0.0858

The Company confirms that the issue price of $0.078 satisfies the requirements of Listing Rule 7.1A.

BARDOC GOLD PROJECT – BACKGROUND

For personal use only

The Bardoc Gold Project was formed in October 2018 following completion of the merger between Excelsior
Gold and Spitfire Materials, bringing together significant resources and excellent potential for growth. The
Bardoc Gold Project runs contiguously north for 40km in the Eastern Goldfields. There are four main
deposits and a multitude of smaller projects within the 250km2 land-holding, providing a large Resource
base and excellent exploration potential within the prolific Norseman-Wiluna greenstone belt and junction
of the Bardoc Tectonic Zone (BTZ) and the Black Flag Fault (BFF).
These two deep-seated crustal structures host many multi-million-ounce deposits, including the worldrenowned Golden Mile in Kalgoorlie.
