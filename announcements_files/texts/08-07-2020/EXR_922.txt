FULLY GAS SATURATED COALS
HIGHLIGHTS
•

Main coal seam interpreted to be fully gas saturated

•

Adsorption results from SGS laboratory in China

•

Test results favourable for future pilot and production phases

•

Spud of Nomgon-2 well is imminent

Elixir Energy Limited (“Elixir” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide an update on its laboratory
adsorption testing results.
The final key laboratory test results from the Nomgon-1 well (which was announced as being a coal
seam gas discovery on 26 February 2020) have now been completed.
Travel and other restrictions due to COVID-19 delayed the volume and timing of transmission of coal
samples to an international standard SGS laboratory in China for some months, but moving forward
this is expected to be smoother. Due to these limitations, only one sample was analysed in the main
“100 series” coal seam, but a broader range of samples will be tested in future.
The resultant adsorption isotherm data derived from this main seam test, combined with the wellsite
desorption analysis, proximate analysis, gas chromatography and Injectivity Fall Off Testing (IFOT),
are interpreted to indicate this main coal to be near fully gas saturated.
Although there is a complex interaction between the multiple different factors that characterize a coal
seam gas play, the potentially very positive consequences of full gas saturation for a coal seam gas
play can be summarized as follows:
•

Pilot production design could be substantially simpler and cheaper. Presuming a successful
appraisal campaign in 2020, Elixir will aim to conduct a pilot production test in 2021.

•

Production testing should be characterized by early gas production, not a lengthy water
producing phase to induce pressure draw-down and gas breakthrough.

•

Water management issues in the development phase could become simpler and cheaper,
hence significantly improving gas production economics.

The Nomgon-2 well is due to spud very shortly. This well is intended to produce the same suite of
test results as its predecessor Nomgon-1. These results will become progressively available after the
well reaches its target depth and samples are either analysed on-site or sent to laboratories in
Mongolia and China.

Elixir’s Managing Director, Mr Neil Young, said: “Identifying fully gas saturated coals in Nomgon-1 is
an excellent result, given the very positive consequences this should have for coal seam gas pilot
production testing and ultimately a field development. Nomgon-1’s very thick coals that have now
been identified as being fully gas saturated suggest a potentially very energy intensive per acre
resource has been found.”
