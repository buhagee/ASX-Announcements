IGO’s Managing Director & CEO Peter Bradford said: “FY20 was a year of unique challenges including
devastating bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout, the Company has demonstrated outstanding
resilience and adaptability while achieving excellent operational performance. I am incredibly proud of this
performance and our teams.”

“At Nova, production of all metals exceeded guidance, with nickel production slightly higher than the top end
of guidance, while copper and cobalt production were ~10% and ~20% higher, respectively.

“Tropicana production ended the year below the mid-point of guidance as we transitioned into the treatment
of stockpiled ore with consequential lower milled grades. Stockpiled ore will continue to be a significant source
of ore through FY21, supplementing run of mine ore from the Boston Shaker open pit and the new underground
mine (which remains on schedule to reach commercial production during the September 2020 quarter) along
with the Havana open pit as the Stage 2 cutback is developed.”

“Our consistent operational performance is a credit to the quality of our assets and competence of our
operational teams. This forms an outstanding platform from which IGO can pursue growth opportunities
through both exploration and disciplined M&A.”
Detailed operational and financial results for these periods, as well as production and cost guidance for the
2021 financial year, will be reported as part of the June 2020 Quarterly Report scheduled to be released on
29 July 2020.
