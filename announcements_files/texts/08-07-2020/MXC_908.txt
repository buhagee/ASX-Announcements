company specialising in the production and development of phytocannabinoid-derived medicines, is
pleased to announce it has been granted an Import Licence by the Australian Office of Drug Control
(ODC). This follows the granting of an Indent Wholesale Licence by the Western Australian Department
of Health on the 26th of May 2020.
The import licence provides an important opportunity for MXC’s Australian operations as it is now able
to directly import Schedule 4 - prescription only medication and Schedule 8 - controlled drugs,
medicinal cannabis product into Australia from its European production facility, a process that was
previously facilitated by Cannvalate and Health House International.
The granting of this licence significantly decreases logistics and handling fees for MXC and supports its
business model of providing high-quality affordable medicinal cannabis products to patients and
progresses the Company towards becoming a vertically integrated bio-pharma company with global
operations.
MGC Pharma will now bulk import its medicinal cannabis products for storage, distribution and sale
across Australia through its commercial channel partners and in due course, MXC will expand
importation to encompass a wider range of products including products from its Mercury Pharma brand
such as MP1:1 (25mg/mL THC:CBD) and MP25T (25mg/mL THC).
The Company continues to work with Cannvalate and other commercial partners to distribute its
proprietary products across the Australian market at very affordable pricing points.
The Company’s next step is to expand its sales team and clinic access, increasing from the retail profit
margins, alongside its distribution channels.
Roby Zomer, Co-founder and Managing Director of MGC Pharma, commented: “The granting of the
import licence in Australia is very significant for our Australian operations, with the logistics savings we
are able to become more cost effective and are also able to expand our product offering to our
Australian customers.“
