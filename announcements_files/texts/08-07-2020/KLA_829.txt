KIRKLAND LAKE GOLD REPORTS SOLID SECOND QUARTER 2020 PRODUCTION
Toronto, Ontario – July 7, 2020 – Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (“Kirkland Lake Gold” or the “Company”) (TSX:KL)
(NYSE:KL) (ASX:KLA) today announced production results for the second quarter (“Q2 2020”) and first half
(“YTD 2020”) of 2020. Q2 2020 production totaled 329,770 ounces, an increase of 115,177 ounces or 54% from
214,593 ounces for the second quarter of 2019 (“Q2 2019”). For YTD 2020, the Company produced 660,634
ounces, 214,162 ounces or 48% higher than the first half of 2019 (“YTD 2019”). All dollar amounts are expressed
in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Highlights of Q2 2020 production results:
• Consolidated Q2 2020 production of 329,770 ounces, a 54% increase from 214,593 ounces in Q2 2019
and largely unchanged from 330,864 ounces the previous quarter (660,634 ounces in YTD 2020 versus
446,472 ounces in YTD 2019)
• Gold poured in Q2 2020 totaling 338,573 ounces versus 216,166 ounces in Q2 2019 and 326,933 ounces
in Q1 2020 (YTD 2020 gold poured of 665,506 ounces compared to 446,417 ounces for YTD 2019)
• Q2 2020 gold sales totaling 341,390 ounces at an average realized price of $1,716 per ounce compared
to gold sales of 212,091 ounces ($1,320 per ounce) in Q2 2019 and 344,586 ounces ($1,586 per ounce)
the previous quarter (YTD 2020 gold sales of 685,976 ounces ($1,650 per ounce) versus gold sales of
445,020 ounces ($1,313 per ounce) for YTD 2019)
• Production from Detour Lake Mine totaling 131,992 ounces despite disruptions caused by COVID-19
(Production from the closing of the Detour Gold Corporation (“Detour Gold”) acquisition on January 31,
2020 to June 30, 2020 totaled 223,547 ounces)
• Strong production at Fosterville of 155,106 ounces, a 10% increase from 140,701 ounces in Q2 2019
mainly reflecting higher tonnes processed; Q2 2020 production was similar to production of 159,864
ounces the previous quarter (YTD 2020 production of 314,970 ounces, 17% higher than 269,145 ounces
in YTD 2019)
• Production at Macassa totaling 41,865 ounces compared to quarterly production of 49,196 ounces in
Q2 2019 with the reduction largely related to a lower average grade; Q2 2020 production compared to
50,861 ounces the previous quarter reflecting a greater impact on tonnes processed from COVID-19
protocols as well as a lower average grade (YTD 2020 production of 92,726 ounces compared to YTD
2019 production of 121,972 ounces)
• Operations at Holt Complex were placed on temporary suspension effective April 2, 2020 with
production for Q2 2020 totaling 807 ounces; Production in Q2 2019 totaled 24,696 ounces, while
production in Q1 2020 totaled 28,584 ounces (YTD 2020 production totaled 29,390 ounces versus 55,355
ounces for YTD 2019).

Other highlights:
• Encouraging exploration results at Macassa Mine including the identification of a new, large corridor
of high-grade mineralization in close proximity to the #4 shaft, currently under development, and also
the continued expansion of the South Mine Complex (“SMC”)
• Exploration success at Detour Lake Mine with initial drilling intersecting broad zones of mineralization
in the Saddle Zone between the Main and West pits at attractive open-pit grades with higher-grade
intervals supporting the possibility for underground Mineral Resources at depth; Drilling at 58 North
Zone intersects high grades 175.0 m west of the current underground Mineral Resource
• Ramp up of reduced operations and suspended non-essential activities commenced in May; COVID19 health and safety protocols remain in place: Workers at Detour Lake and Macassa began to be
recalled starting in early May after both mines transitioned to reduced operations due to COVID-19
around the end of March; Exploration drilling and work on key projects resumed early in Q2 2020 after
being suspended in late Q1 2020 (exploration drilling to ramp up over the next few months); Extensive
1

health and safety protocols introduced in March remain in place, with many protocols relating to
medical screening and social distancing expected to remain for the foreseeable future
• Cash position of $537 million with no debt at June 30, 2020; $133 million paid in Australia during Q2
2020 representing the final tax instalment for the 2019 tax year; $50 million used in Q2 2020 to
repurchase 1,345,600 common shares through the Company’s normal course issuer bid (total YTD 2020
share repurchases of 11,059,100 common shares for $380 million).
Tony Makuch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kirkland Lake Gold, commented: “We had a very solid
second quarter despite the impact of COVID-19 and the extensive measures we took to protect our workers,
their families and our communities. In Australia, Fosterville continued to perform well, with tonnes processed
increasing in the quarter and grades continuing to average around 40 g/t. At Detour Lake, the ramp up of
business activities after the mine was placed on reduced operations in March due to COVID-19 commenced in
early May and has gone very well. Detour Lake produced over 130,000 ounces in Q2 2020 even with lower
average grades during the period of reduced operations due largely to processing stockpiled material. With
improving operating performance, strong free cash flow generation and very encouraging exploration results
from early drilling, our acquisition of Detour Gold is already emerging as a very successful transaction, with
substantial value creation potential. We have also benefited greatly from our decision to close out Detour
Gold’s hedge positions shortly after the acquisition, with Detour’s gold hedges priced between $1,300 and
$1,490 per ounce versus our average realized price in Q2 2020 of $1,716 per ounce. Turning to Macassa, our
processing volumes were impacted by COVID-19 more than at other operations, which in combination with
lower grades resulted in Q2 2020 production below planned levels. With our workforce now back to pre-COVID19 levels, recognizing that our social distancing protocols remain in place, we expect to see higher volumes and
improved grades at Macassa during the second half of the year. We also continue to generate encouraging
exploration results at Macassa, which highlight the potential for considerable growth in Mineral Reserves and
Mineral Resources in the SMC and along both the Main/’04 and Amalgamated breaks.”

1) The Detour Lake Mine was acquired on January 31, 2020. Production in Q1 2020 represents output from that date to March
31, 2020. YTD 2020 production represents output from that date to June 30, 2020.
2) The Holloway Mine, a component of Holt Complex, was placed on care and maintenance in March 2020 with no plans for a
resumption of operations. The remainder of the Holt Complex was placed on temporary suspension effective April 2, 2020
as part of the Company’s COVID-19 response. The Complex remained on temporary suspension as at June 30, 2020.

After withdrawing guidance for 2020 on April 2, 2020 due to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Company issued new guidance on June 30, 2020, including the production guidance provided in the table
above. YTD 2020 production totaled 660,634 ounces, an increase of 48% from 446,472 ounces for YTD 2019
and compared to full-year guidance of 1,350,000 – 1,400,000 ounces. The main contributor to the strong
growth compared to the same period in 2019 was the contribution of 223,547 ounces from Detour Lake,
following the acquisition of Detour Gold on January 31, 2020. Partially offsetting the contribution from Detour
Lake was lower production at the Holt Complex (29,390 ounces for YTD 2020 versus 55,355 ounces for YTD
2019) as a result of the operation being placed on temporary suspension effective April 2, 2020. At June 30,
2020, Fosterville was tracking well against its full-year 2020 production guidance. Production at Detour Lake
and Macassa is expected to increase in the second half of 2020 with production activities at both mines having
ramped up after being placed on reduced operations near the end of March as part of the Company’s COVID19 response. Production of 29,390 ounces from Holt Complex in YTD 2020 is included in the Company’s reissued 2020 production guidance. This re-issued guidance assumes no production from the Holt Complex in
the second half of the year.
Review of Operations
Fosterville
The Fosterville Mine produced 155,106 ounces in Q2 2020 based on processing 123,473 tonnes at an average
grade of 39.5 g/t and average mill recoveries of 99.0%. Q2 2020 production increased 10% from 140,701 ounces
in Q2 2019, when the mine processed 111,280 tonnes at an average grade of 39.9 g/t and average recoveries
of 98.7%. Q2 2020 production compared to production of 159,864 ounces the previous quarter when the mine
recorded an average quarterly grade of 42.4 g/t at average recoveries of 98.8%. The higher average grade in
Q1 2020 reflected mine sequencing in the lower Phoenix system.
Production at Fosterville for YTD 2020 totaled 314,970 ounces, a 17% increase from 269,145 ounces for YTD
2019. YTD 2020 production resulted from processing 242,175 tonnes at an average grade of 40.9 g/t and
average recoveries of 98.9%. The increase from YTD 2019 was mainly due to a 21% improvement in the average
grade, to 40.9 g/t for YTD 2020. Mill throughput in YTD 2020 averaged 1,331 tonnes per day compared to 1,390
tonnes per day for YTD 2019.
Macassa
Production at Macassa in Q1 2020 totaled 41,865 ounces compared to production of 49,196 ounces in Q2 2019.
Production in Q2 2020 resulted from processing 77,624 tonnes at an average grade of 17.2 g/t and average
recoveries of 97.6%, which compared to 72,681 tonnes processed in Q2 2019 at an average grade of 21.5 g/t
and average recoveries of 97.9%. The change in production from Q2 2019 largely reflected a lower average
grade and the impact of reduced operations due to COVID-19, which resulted in lower than planned tonnes

processed in Q2 2020. Production in Q2 2020 compared to production of 50,861 ounces the previous quarter
when the mine processed 82,256 tonnes at an average grade of 19.7 g/t and average recoveries of 97.7%. The
reduction in tonnes processed compared to Q1 2020 largely reflected a greater impact from the transition to
reduced operations due to COVID-19 in Q2 2020 compared to the previous quarter.
Production at Macassa in YTD 2020 totaled 92,726 ounces, which resulted from processing 159,879 tonnes at
an average grade of 18.5 g/t and at average recoveries of 97.6%. YTD 2020 production compared to production
of 121,972 ounces for YTD 2019, which resulted from processing 150,671 tonnes at an average grade of 25.7
g/t and at average recoveries of 98.1%. YTD 2020 production was below expected levels largely reflecting lower
than planned tonnes processed as a result of the transition to reduced operations due to COVID-19, as well as
lower than expected grades. Both tonnes processed and average grades are expected to increase in the second
half of 2020.
Detour Lake
Production at Detour Lake in Q2 2020 totaled 131,992 ounces, which involved processing 5,655,992 tonnes at
an average grade of 0.79 g/t at average recoveries of 91.7%. Production in Q2 2020 compared to production
for the two months from January 31, 2020, the date the acquisition of Detour Gold was completed, to March
31, 2020 of 91,555 ounces, which resulted from processing 3,708,022 tonnes at an average grade of 0.84 g/t
and at average recoveries of 90.9%. Tonnes processed in Q2 2020 averaged 62,154 tonnes per day, largely
unchanged from the average in February and March. The lower average grade in Q2 2020 compared to the two
months ended March 31, 2020, was mainly due to feeding lower grade stockpiled material to the mill during
reduced operations. Production at Detour Lake for the five months ended June 30, 2020 totaled 223,547
ounces, which resulted from processing 9,364,014 tonnes at an average grade of 0.81 g/t and at average
recoveries of 91.4%.
Holt Complex
The assets included in the Holt Complex (Holt, Holloway and Taylor mines and Holt Mill) were designated as
non-core on February 19, 2020 with the Company planning to assess options for maximizing the value of these
assets. In March 2020, the Holloway Mine was transitioned to care and maintenance with no plans for a future
resumption of operations. Effective April 2, 2020, the remainder of the Holt Complex was placed on temporary
suspension effective April 2, 2020 as part of the Company’s COVID-19 response. As a result, there was almost
no production from Holt Complex in Q2 2020 (807 ounces produced). Production in Q2 2019 totaled 24,696
ounces, which resulted from processing 185,398 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t and average recoveries
of 95.0%. Production from the Holt Complex in Q1 2020 totaled 28,584 ounces, which resulted from processing
209,126 tonnes at an average grade of 4.6 g/t and at average recoveries of 93.4%. For YTD 2020, the Holt
Complex produced 29,390 ounces from processing 215,318 tonnes at an average grade of 4.5 g/t and average
recoveries of 93.6%.
At June 30, 2020, the Holt Complex remained on temporary suspension while the Company continued to assess
options for the future of the Holt Complex assets. YTD production of 29,390 ounces from Holt Complex is
included in the Company’s re-issued 2020 production guidance, with no production assumed in the second half
of the year.

has a great amount of uncertainty as to its existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed
that any or part of an "indicated Mineral Resource" or "Inferred Mineral Resource" will ever be upgraded to a
higher category of resource. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of mineral deposits in
these categories will ever be converted into proven and probable reserves.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forwardlooking information prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended,
planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. Although Kirkland Lake Gold has attempted to identify
important risks, uncertainties and factors which could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be
others that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Kirkland Lake Gold does not intend,
and do not assume any obligation, to update this forward-looking information except as otherwise required by
applicable law.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates
All resource and reserve estimates included in this news release or documents referenced in this news release
have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for
Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the "CIM") CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended
(the "CIM Standards"). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators, which
established standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning
mineral projects. The terms "mineral reserve", "proven mineral reserve" and "probable mineral reserve" are
Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards. These definitions differ
materially from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7 ("SEC Industry Guide 7") under the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act.
In addition, the terms "Mineral Resource", "measured Mineral Resource", "indicated Mineral Resource" and
"Inferred Mineral Resource" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards;
however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be
used in reports and registration statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be
converted into reserves. "Inferred Mineral Resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence,
and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an
Inferred Mineral Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of
Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in very limited
circumstances. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a Mineral Resource exists, will ever
be converted into a Mineral Reserve or is or will ever be economically or legally mineable or recovered.
