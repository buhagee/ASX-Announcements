NEW NICKEL SULPHIDE TARGETS DELINEATED AT SAINTS
Highlights
•

Electromagnetic (EM) surveys successfully define two new conductors at the T2 and T1 Targets to
be tested by upcoming drill programme at Saints commencing next week

•

Recently-completed drill-testing of the previously reported strong EM conductor confirmed a 12
metre-thick zone of massive sulphides on the margin of the T2 channel

•

4,200m air-core (AC) drilling programme at the Valdez Prospect has been completed; drill rig
mobilising to Saints to complete 1,300m AC programme at the T4 Target

•

~$550,000 received by the Company under the Research and Development Tax Incentive which will
contribute to the upcoming exploration programmes and working capital requirements; the
Company remains well funded with ~$3.4 million cash on hand

Auroch Minerals Limited (ASX:AOU) (Auroch or the Company) is pleased to announce EM surveys
conducted during the recent reverse circulation (RC) drilling programme has identified two new nickel
sulphide drill targets at its Saints Nickel Project (Saints).
The RC programme comprised three drill-holes (Table 1) to test the T2 channel target, one of the highly
fertile basal channels identified by the Company (Figure 1), and a fourth drill-hole in the T1 Target area.
In particular, one of the drill-holes (SNRC005) was designed to test a very strong down-hole EM (DHEM)
conductor identified in the northern part of the T2 channel during the previous RC drilling campaign.1
SNRC005 intersected twelve metres of massive sulphides2 from 112m, coincident with the modelled
DHEM conductor, thus proving the validity of DHEM as a tool to target massive sulphides (Figure 2 and
Figure 3). Whilst not nickeliferous, the sulphide mineralisation was anomalous in copper and zinc, typical
of sedimentary exhalative-style sulphidic mineralisation commonly found on the margins of nickel-bearing
basal channels.
A DHEM survey of drill-hole SNRC007, drilled further to the south in the T2 channel, successfully defined
another strong conductor located deeper within the T2 channel (Figure 2). The strength of the conductor
was again very high at 15,000 – 30,000+ S, which is considered a typical signature of well-developed
sulphides. The strong conductor is also very discreet, which means it is less likely to be caused from
conductive stratigraphic units and more likely to be from localised sulphide mineralisation.
Assay results for SNRC007 confirmed that the basal ultramafic unit in the T2 channel target was a highly
fertile, high MgO nickel-bearing lava flow, characteristics necessary for significant nickel sulphide
mineralisation. An intersection of 2m @ 0.61% Ni from 96m was recorded immediately above the basal
contact with the underlying basalt (see Appendix 1 for full table of results)2.
A follow-up drilling programme to test the strong conductor at T2 has already been planned, and is
scheduled to commence next week.
A second EM conductor was identified within the T1 Target area. Whilst not as strong as the T2 conductor,
the fixed loop EM (FLEM) conductor at T1 is coincident with the modelled basal channel position, and

hence will also be drill tested in the upcoming drill programme. Originally thought to be one large channel,
the T1 Target area has now been modelled as several smaller channels, which may indicate close proximity
to the original vent source.
Auroch Managing Director Aidan Platel commented:
“We are very pleased with the results from our latest RC programme at Saints. Whilst unfortunately
non-nickeliferous, the thick zone of massive sulphides intersected on the margins of the T2 channel
really confirms our geological and geophysical models, which means we can confidently target
modelled EM conductors within our interpreted basal channel positions with future drilling
programmes. The new conductor identified at T2 appears to be in a compelling position in the T2
channel, and we will be testing that immediately with drilling to commence next week.
We look forward to also testing another EM conductor in the T1 Target area, as well as drilling some
AC lines over the T4 Target to get that ready for a follow-up RC programme. We are also planning
some deeper diamond holes for the Saint Andrews channel for later this month, so we are really
ramping up the exploration at Saints.
We are also extremely pleased to have completed the 4,200m AC programme at the exciting Valdez
Prospect of our Leinster Nickel Project. We are busy modelling the results and are aiming to follow up
with an RC drilling programme in August.
We have a significant pipeline of quality nickel sulphide targets, both at Saints and Leinster, and we
are ramping up our exploration efforts to systematically develop and then drill-test each of these
targets.”

The Company is pleased to announce it has completed the 4,000m air-core drilling programme at the
Valdez Prospect near Leinster, Western Australia. When received, the results will be used to characterise
the ultramafics and define possible basal channels in the footwall contact, which will then be targeted
with an RC drilling programme in August.
The AC drill-rig has now mobilised to Saints, where it will complete a 1,300m drill programme over the T4
Target area. It is expected that this programme will be completed within a week.
Auroch is also pleased to advise that it has received a rebate of approximately $550,000 under the
Research & Development Tax Incentive . This money will be used to advance the exploration programmes
at the Saints and Leinster Nickel Projects, as well as for general working capital. The Company remains
well funded with $3.4 million in cash as at 30 June 2020.

●

Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut
channels, random chips, or specific specialised
industry standard measurement tools
appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc).
These examples should not be taken as limiting
the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or
systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation
that are Material to the Public Report. In cases
where ‘industry standard’ work has been done
this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse
circulation drilling was used to obtain 1m
samples from which 3kg was pulverised to
produce a 30g charge for fire assay’). In other
cases more explanation may be required, such
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules)
may warrant disclosure of detailed
information.

1996 – 1998 (WMC): Core samples are
documented as ‘split’ in statutory
annual reporting; it is assumed that
half core was sampled for analysis and
may have been hand-split with a chisel
or similar tool rather than sawn.
2002 – 2005 (Scotia Nickel): Core was
sampled as sawn half or quarter core,
generally in continuous lengths with
sampling consistently on the same
side of the core.
2006 – 2008 (Breakaway): Core was
sampled predominantly as sawn half
core with some quarter core,
generally in continuous lengths with
sampling consistently on the same
side of the core.
Measures taken by WMC, Scotia
Nickel and Breakaway 1996 - 2008 to
ensure RC, percussion or AC sample
representivity have not been
documented.
1m and 2m RC, percussion or AC
samples and maximum1m length core
samples, or as close as reasonable
within geological boundaries, are
considered appropriate for the style of
mineralisation being targeted.
Historic drill holes were logged at level
of detail to ensure sufficient
geological understanding to allow
representative selection of sample
intervals.
Sampling QAQC measures taken by
WMC, Scotia Nickel and Breakaway
1996 – 2008 have not been
documented.
It is assumed that WMC, Scotia Nickel
and Breakaway sample sizes were
appropriate for the type, style and
thickness of mineralisation tested.
2019 (Auroch Minerals) core is sawn
and sampled as half or quarter core.
Half core samples range from 0.31.2m based on geological boundaries
which is considered representative for
NQ2 core and the style of
mineralisation targeted. A single side
of the core is selected for sample
consistently throughout the hole.
2020 (Auroch Minerals); AC 3kg

JORC CODE EXPLANATION

COMMENTARY

●

These relationships are particularly important in
the reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect
to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should
be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths
are reported, there should be a clear statement to
this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true width not
known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for
any significant discovery being reported These
should include, but not be limited to a plan view of
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional
views.

●

Most drill holes were angled to the east so
that intersections are orthogonal to the
orientation of mineralisation.

●

Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting
of both low and high grades and/or widths should
be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including (but not
limited to): geological observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or
large-scale step-out drilling).
