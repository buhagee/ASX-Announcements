Proposed issue of +securities
Information and documents given to ASX become ASX’s property and may be made public.
If you are an entity incorporated outside Australia and you are proposing to issue a new class of
+securities other than CDIs, you will need to obtain and provide an International Securities
Identification Number (ISIN) for that class. Similarly, if you are an entity incorporated outside Australia,
the +securities proposed to be issued are in an existing class of +security but the event timetable
includes a period of rights or +deferred settlement trading, you will need to obtain and provide an ISIN
code for the rights and/or the deferred settlement +securities. Further information on the requirement
for the notification of an ISIN is available from the Create Online Forms page. ASX is unable to create
the new ISIN for non-Australian issuers.
*Denotes minimum information required for first lodgement of this form, with exceptions provided in
specific notes for certain questions. The balance of the information, where applicable, must be
provided as soon as reasonably practicable by the entity.
