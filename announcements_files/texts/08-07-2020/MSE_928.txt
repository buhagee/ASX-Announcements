Ms Tulloch was founding Managing Director of Dyesol Limited, a company established to
commercialise the R&D into 3rd generation solar technology, which had been undertaken by
the Australian team since 1995. Dyesol listed on the ASX in 2005, and during her tenure took

About Metalsearch
Our objective is to become an Australian industrial mineral and compound producer,
underpinned by patent-pending technologies. We remain focused on the development of our
Queensland based Abercorn Project, acquired in August 2019. Abercorn is a large-scale
kaolin prospect, which has the potential to underpin the production of kaolin mineral product
for global markets and industrial compounds manufactured by using our novel and proprietary
mineral processing technologies.
The Company is working with the University of Queensland to develop and commercialise
novel and proprietary zeolite mineral processing technology that consumes kaolin or suitable
mine tailings to produce high value zeolites. The technology has the potential to fast track
development of the Abercorn Project, with a low capital cost to reach commercial production,
utilising the company’s existing kaolin feedstock.
It also provides potential opportunities to monetise broader application of the technology
outside the company by offering a significantly lower cost method of manufacturing zeolites
compared to conventional processes.
About the Abercorn Project
The Abercorn Project has demonstrated it contains a resource of significant scale and a very
consistent, high quality grade of kaolinite mineralisation. The resource remains open in all
directions with less than circa 10% of the Project area being drilled, leaving potential for
substantial future upgrade.
Total Maiden Resource1 for the Abercorn Project area is 39.06Mt yielding 36.8% -20µm
grading 28.6% Al2O3 containing the following high-grade sections:
•
•

An area called the Railcut Prospect contains 14Mt yielding 38% -20µm fraction grading
30.26% Al2O3
An area called the Area 3 Prospect contains 1.66 Mt yielding 30.9% -20µm fraction
grading 30.7% Al2O3

Large scale mineralised system from surface
86 RC holes drilled - kaolinite intersected in every hole
Resource remains open in all directions
Potential for significant resource upgrade - drilling represents less than 10% of
tenement
Low cost operation - straight forward open cut mining
Little to no overburden
Low impurities

Large water supply nearby and within EPM

The Abercorn Project is situated approximately 135km south of the deep-water port of
Gladstone and 125km west of the deep-water port of Bundaberg in central Queensland. Both
major ports are connected to the Abercorn Project by sealed roads. The Burnett highway
bisects the tenements.
