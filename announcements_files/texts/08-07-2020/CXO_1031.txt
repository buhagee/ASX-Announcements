Rock-chip gold grades of up to 170 g/t Au (including 128 g/t Au) at the Possum Prospect
have only been scantly followed up by previous explorers. During short periods of goldfocussed exploration in the late 1980’s and early 2010’s. The exploration programs
encountered numerous gold vein systems similar to those at the nearby Cosmo gold
mine, operated by Kirkland Lake Resources (NYSE: KL, TSX:KL, ASX: KLA) (Kirkland Lake).
Kirkland Lake, which recently completed a A$5 billion takeover of Detour Gold (TSX:DGC),
also announced drill results from the nearby Lantern Deposit at Cosmo grading of 578 g/t
Au over 1.8 m and 67.6g/t Au over 3.1 m (ASX:KLA 18/12/2019). Kirkland Lake has estimated
a total gold NT Mineral Resource of 2,680,000oz @ 2.5g/t , including 1,410,000oz @ 2.5g/t
Measured and Indicated and Inferred Resource of 1,270,000oz @ 2.6g/t gold (Kirkland
Lake 19/2/2020).
This highly prospective gold region in the NT has potential for long-term, profitable
mining operations in a historic mining district with over 4.5 million ounces of gold
produced over the past four decades (Figure 4).
Core’s new tenement area hosts extensive laminated quartz veins that locally contain fine
visible gold and sulphide-hosted gold, not unlike many of the other gold deposits of the
Pine Creek and Cosmo Howley Mineral Fields (Figures 2 & 3).
The Adelaide River prospects have received limited exploration to date. Previous
geochemical and geophysical surveys of the broader tenement area were limited to small
programs over localised areas and individual prospects. Core sees a significant
opportunity to take a more consolidated and systematic approach to exploration over this
highly prospective area.
Core plans to undertake further research, assessment and interpretation of the historic
datasets and exploration information for the Project over coming months, and expects to
update the market as the Company refines its understanding of the Project and
progresses plans to commence initial fieldwork on this exciting new gold Project later this
year.
Core Lithium’s Managing Director, Stephen Biggins, commented:
“The exciting gold prospectivity of Adelaide River as demonstrated by these very high
gold grades as well as new gold results from Finniss earlier this year, strengthens our
view that the district has a strong gold endowment.
“Core is still firmly focussed on the development of our flagship Finniss Lithium Project;
however, we see this new project is an obvious opportunity to leverage the expertise and
capabilities of our exploration team and NT experience to add value for Core’s
shareholders.
“We look forward to extending our NT gold exploration program to cover Adelaide River
over the course of 2020.”

Possum Prospect
Historic assays up to 170 g/t Au (including 128 g/t Au) in rock chips at Possum have been
noted by Core in historic surface sampling at the prospect.
22 rockchip samples collected mostly by Northern Gold assay above 5 g/t Au (Figure 1 and
Table 1) - 55 of the results assayed above 0.5 g/t and the average grade was 24.7 g/t (mean
6.6 g/t).

The highest-grade sample was panned and produced a 3cm tail of fine visible gold.
Gold mineralisation at Possum has been identified within a 0.8m wide and >300m long
laminated quartz vein that occurs within a broader 10m wide zone of quartz veining,
silicification and weak bleaching.
Soil sampling for Bulk Leach Extractable Gold (BLEG) analysis returned two parallel
anomalies; 300m x 100m up to 129 ppb Au and 400m x 60 m up to 51 ppb Au, with both
soil anomalies open to the north (Figure 2).
Limited drilling of RC/diamond tails (3 holes; Figure 1) indicated that a narrow saddle reef
is present at ~40-50m depth. Drilling identified three veins in a 10m wide fault-shear zone
which contains a pervasive stock work of fractures and veinlets of quartz and pyrite which
was intersected in all holes at the contact between a shale and greywacke unit. Although,
the drill core was not thoroughly assayed and has not been retained, best results include:
o
o

POS1DDH: 0.2m @ 5.94 g/t Au from 93.4m
POS3DDH: 0.3m @ 4.78 g/t Au from 51.6m.

Substantial upside exists down-plunge to the south and along adjacent structures and
fold limbs, as highlighted by soil sampling. There is currently limited rockchip sampling
beyond the current quartz reef. There is also strong potential outside of the current soil
grid to the northwest, south and west (Figure 2).

Arum Prospect
Arum Prospect was defined as gold in soil anomaly 200m NE of the Adelaide River Mine
uranium workings, along a conglomerate and greywacke contact containing a stock work
zone over 50m wide and 1,000m long, with pyritic alteration with anomalous gold up to
8.4 g/t in rockchips (Figure 3).
The Adelaide River and George Creek mines produced 3,500t of pitchblende ore at 0.5%
for 17.5t U3O8 used as supplementary feed for the Rum Jungle processing plant.
The highest gold assays relate to samples that are difficult to geolocate. However,
subsequent exploration by Royal Resources has confirmed the tenor, with five samples
returning between 0.04 and 1.9 g/t Au. Assays show excellent repeatability and a strong
correlation between Au-As±Ag.
A large 500m x 50m anomaly of up to 1,000ppb Au (30-1000 ppb) is open to the south.
RC Drilling by Northern Gold Ltd intersected ferruginous quartz veins, with the best result
being 1.6 g/t Au over 1m. The vertical drilling appears to be a poor test of the likely steep
mineralisation and the location of the drilling is uncertain.

Additional gold prospectivity
The distribution of geochemical data is strongly correlated with known prospects, and
less than 10% of the project area is covered by baseline data, and far less by multi-element
data.
Geological mapping indicates that there are zones of favourable structure and rockcontrast to host gold-bearing quartz veins, which have received almost no exploration
focus.
For example, Northern Gold Ltd commented that gold is concentrated at the same
stratigraphic horizon at Happy Valley and Arum Prospects and this conglomerategreywacke contact continues over 3.5km strike between the two prospects. They further
note the presence of several stockwork zones over 50m wide and up to 1km long, with
distinctive pervasive pyritic alteration with anomalous Gold (up to 1 g/t Au). This zone is
not covered by existing soils data and a broader geochemical dataset would appear to be
essential in future exploration throughout the tenement.
Summary of Geology and Previous Exploration
EL31886 is located immediately south of Adelaide River township, 80km south of Darwin
along the Stuart Highway (Figure 4). Core’s tenement lies along regional structures within
geologically diverse rock types of the Finniss River Group within the Pine Creek Mineral
Field.
The area has been explored and mined historically for uranium, however, short periods of
gold-focussed exploration in the late 1980’s and early 2010’s encountered numerous gold
vein systems not unlike those at Cosmo Howley to the south (ASX: KLA). Despite highly
anomalous rock chip gold grades at a number of prospects these have only been scantly
followed up, and where drilled, only narrow intersections materialised at depth and
discouraged further testing. This phenomenon is not unlike Cosmo Howley and other
Pine Creek gold prospects, which are characterised by individually narrow and
discontinuous veins with high gold grades that are collectively more significant. In
addition, drilling took place without consideration of a plunge to the quartz veins.
The area is made up of a dissected terrain of tightly-folded Finniss River Group,
unconformably overlain by younger flat-lying sediments of the Birrindudu Basin. This
unconformity is likely to be responsible for a number of historic uranium mines, including
Adelaide River and George Creek mines, which produced 3,800t of pitchblende ore at
0.5% for 19t U3O8, used as supplementary feed for the Rum Jungle processing plant (BMR
Record 1958-0042). While this style of mineralisation is of diminished interest at present,
the tenement also hosts extensive laminated quartz veins that locally contain fine visible
gold and sulphide-hosted gold, not unlike many of the other gold deposits of the Pine
Creek and Cosmo Howley Goldfields (Figure 4).

Commentary

Sampling
techniques

• Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or
specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate
to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity
and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to
the Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be
relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1
m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge
for fire assay’). In other cases, more explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g.
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.

All data referred to in this report is of historic nature and includes:
o Drillholes: 3 holes geolocated
o Rockchips with assays: 57 samples
o Soils Samples with assays
o Stream Sediment Samples with assays
Data was derived from historic company reports held by the Northern Territory
Geological Survey (NTGS). These reports are in a digital form and available on-line
via GEMIS.
o Data prior to about 1995 is generally in the form of scanned PDFs and TIFs
of original reports and digital data has been procured by transcribing into
a spreadsheet. The NTGS have carried out a certain amount of this task,
but part of the task has also been carried out by modern explorers,
including Aldershot Resources Ltd, Royal Resources Ltd and Core Lithium
Ltd.
o More modern reports were submitted in a digital form, including drilling
and surface sampling data.
o Data was compiled and validated by Core.
Reverse Circulation (RC), Diamond core (DDH) and Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drill
sampling has been carried out since 1955.
Rockchips and soil sampling were also carried out in the period 1980 to present.
The current knowledge of sampling employed for the surface samples and drill
material are variable. Certain reports describe the sampling methodology, which
matches modern standards. Other companies have failed to provide accurate
sampling methodology.

• Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and
geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate
Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical
studies.
• Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or
costean, channel, etc) photography.
• The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.
• If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core
taken.
• If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and
whether sampled wet or dry.
• For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the
sample preparation technique.
• Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to
maximise representivity of samples.
• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the
in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field
duplicate/second-half sampling.
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the
material being sampled.
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and
laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered
partial or total.

•

Reverse Circulation (RC), Diamond core (DDH) and Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drill
techniques have been employed by a variety of companies at Adelaide River
Project EL31886 since 1955.

• Due to the historic nature of the drilling, sample recoveries cannot be established
with confidence.

• Geological logging data was collected for all drill holes reviewed herein and appears
to be of good quality. Data is generally in a graphical form for holes older than 1995.
• The geological logging is of sufficient quality to allow inclusion into a Mineral
Resource, however, the collar positions, downhole survey, sampling and assay
metadata are not of sufficient quality to enable this.

• Due to the historic nature of the pre-1995 drilling, sub-sampling procedures cannot
be established with confidence. Those holes drilled since appear to have been
sampled in accordance to accepted practices of today. This includes the use of
duplicates.
• There is data pertaining to field and laboratory duplicates in relation to the surface
samples, and assessment of this data suggests good correlation between original
and duplicate. Due to the historic nature, it is not possible to determine the sample
size in most cases.

as part of an approved data submission process (GGIPAC). All assaying took place at
a laboratory with either NATA accreditation or that was in regular use by various
companies in the region at the time. Assay Corp in Pine Creek were responsible for
almost all of the gold assays and they remain the preeminent laboratory for gold
assays for Core Lithium Ltd, and a number of other gold explorers and developers
in the area, including Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.
Reports indicate that laboratory repeats and internal standards were used in
keeping with industry best practice. As noted above, laboratory repeats show an
excellent correlation with the original assay.
Base metal analysis methods for most surface samples and drill samples are 4 acid
digest, ICP-OES/MS. Some soil samples have been instead analysed via a partial
digest method to improve sensitivity. These have been separated from the totaldigest dataset.
Gold analysis has been carried out in various ways. Most of the rockchips are classic
fire assay ICP, but there are some small trial sets of Aqua regia digest, which was
found to be inappropriate for the host rocks. Roughly half of the soil samples are
BLEG, while the rest are fire assay-ICP. These various methods are tagged in Core’s
dataset.
Verification of surface sampling anomalies has been carried out at most of the
prospects by a number of previous companies (not including Core Lithium Ltd)
and has been found to show good repeatability for gold, especially given the
nuggety nature of most gold systems.

• Most data have valid location information from the original source, such as location
method (eg GPS or Local grid transformation).
• Most of the surface sampling and drilling by the BMR and Northern Gold Ltd took
place on local grids specific to each prospect. These were challenging to transform
into the GDA94 grid. This was carried out by Aldershot Resources Ltd and Core
Lithium Ltd using scanned maps, registered with multiple local ground control
points where features are indisputably mapped correctly. The resultant
transformation is likely to have an accuracy of 20m or better.
• In the case of Arum Prospect, the local grid could not be transformed and assay data
have been excluded for the time being, except where flagged as unlocated.

possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering
the deposit type.
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the
orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have
introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if
material.

• Going forward, the aim is to locate grid pegs and drill collars to locate Arum, and to
improve the transformation at the other prospects.
• The grid system is MGA_GDA94, zone 52 for easting, northing and RL.
• Drill spacings are variable as this project is exploration stage.
• Soil sampling grids are generally on 100x20m or 100x10m basis.
• Assays are generally composited to 1m intervals, except for diamond drill core,
where intervals as small as 0.2m are quoted.

Sample
security

• The measures taken to ensure sample security.

• The relationship between drill axis and geological grain has not been established
at a number of the gold prospects, as there is ambiguity in the orientation of
quartz veins. There appears to be poor choice of drill dip at a number of the
prospects, such as Arum, because the vertical shallow holes are unlikely to have
tested what is thought to be sub-vertical quartz veins. In contrast, drillholes at
Possum are well placed and angled to intersect the mapped easterly dip of the
quartz veins orthogonally.
• The geometric understanding of the uranium prospects is quite good and drilling is
oriented approximately perpendicular to the interpreted strike of mineralization
as mapped at surface. Because of the dip of the holes, drill intersections are
apparent thicknesses and overall geological context is needed to estimate true
thicknesses.
• No sampling bias is believed to have been introduced.
• Due to the historic nature of the data presented, this cannot be determined.

• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.

• The project comprises one exploration licence application (EL31886)
covering 82km2 in the name of DBL Blues Pty Ltd, a 100% owned
subsidiary of Core Lithium Ltd. The tenement was applied for in April
2018 and the application process is currently pending issue of a
notification period under the Native Title Act.
• A small portion on the NW corner lies within Litchfield National Park,
which Core is likely to exclude from exploration. If this slows grant
appreciably, Core intends to exclude this from the application. This is a
routine procedure carried out by the NT Department of Primary Industry
and Resources Titles Branch.
• The remainder of the project covers two perpetual crown leases (4724 &
94). These are effectively private allotments, which will require a Notice
of Entry according to the NT Mining Act. This is not unusual land-holding
status in the Katherine to Darwin corridor, and has not prevented the
previous explorer from accessing and exploring the land.
• Uranium mining was undertaken by the Australian Government (BMR,
operated by AUC) between 1950 and 1957 at the Adelaide River and
George Creek uranium mines. Mining ceased 1957 after the workings
were flooded. The shafts are still evident and have been covered with
concrete and metal plates to protect the public. No other mining has
taken place, but the project has a long history of gold, base metals and
uranium exploration (summarised below). The BMR and AUC drilled 25
diamond drill holes between the two deposits and estimated small
resources.
• The history of gold and tin mining in the Pine Creek Orogen dates back as
far as the 1880s. It has had a varied history since. The earliest
documented exploration within EL31886 (i.e., reported in any detailed
way) was by the BMR, as noted above.

proposed that the existing mineralization closely relates to the
Mesoproterozoic unconformity. They also realized the base metal
potential, but did not explore for it in any meaningful way.
Urangesellschaft Australia (EL2055) in the late 1970s similarly concluded
the style of uranium mineralization was like that in the Alligator Rivers
Region. They flew airborne EM (INPUT) and identified a number of
conductors, some of which they attributed to stratigraphic features, likely
graphitic shales. None were drilled.
• Gold exploration commenced in 1987, firstly by small operators, who
joint ventured with Northern Gold Ltd in 1990. They undertook regional
rockchip and stream sediment sampling to begin with, identifying a
number of prospects based on anomalous results (>1 g/t Au). Gold was
also noted at the old uranium mines. Subsequently, soil grids were carried
out at the most coherent anomalies: Possum, Happy Valley, Arum (and
adjacent Adelaide River mine trend) and George Creek mine trend. More
detailed rockchip sampling and improved understanding of the geology
led to the discovery of bonanza grades at a number of sites, including
Possum, where they identified a continuous laminated quartz vein
averaging 0.8m wide and >300m long, with up to 170 ppm Au (21 samples
collected above 5 ppm). Although mapping was carried out, it was largely
not submitted with their annual reports. Drilling on the prospects was
limited and shallow in nature, partly due to terrain and Northern Gold’s
other commitments in the Pine Creek region (including mining and milling
operations).
• Following a decline in the gold sector in 2007, Aldershot Resources
(EL24550 & EL27354) began exploring for uranium again. Their work
included data compilation (a basis for much of what is presented herein),
geological mapping, rock-chip sampling, soil surveys, gridded radiometric
surveys, airborne magnetic & radiometrics, and drilling (12x RC/DDH
holes). Of particular note is the detailed, high-quality 1:10,000 scale
geological mapping. This shows patterns linked to mineralisation of both
uranium and gold. The main focus of drilling was the two historic uranium
mines, where Aldershot attempted to better understand and extend the

mineralization. They concluded that mineralization was more extensive
than defined by the BMR, but was narrow and too low grade to consider
seriously. An IP survey was undertaken in the vicinity of the Adelaide
River mine and identified weak chargeability and conductivity anomalies
that warranted drill testing. Only one (Amangal) was followed up by
drilling and found to be highly graphitic shales with weak base metals.
In 2013, Royal took over the licences and refocussed onto the gold
potential. Previous Northern Gold prospects were verified in the field:
Possum up to 11 ppm; Happy Valley 13 ppm; Arum 1.9 ppm. A number of
new gold prospects were also identified by geological mapping, soils and
rock-chip sampling: Croc Paté (up to 11.3 ppm Au), Croc Paté North (8.3
ppm) and Happy Valley North (1.7 ppm).
Although a number of programs were proposed by Royal Resources and
then Magnetite Mines, including drilling and geophysics, no further work
was reported after 2014.
The Adelaide River Project is situated within the Central Province of the
Pine Creek Orogen and is located between the Rum Jungle and the
Howley Mineral Fields (refer to figures in report). The geology is
dominated by well-bedded shale, phyllite, siltstone, sandstone,
greywacke and conglomerate sediments within the Meso-Proterozoic
Burrell Creek Formation of the Finniss River Group. The recognition of
bouma sequences and other textural structures suggest deposition as a
deep-water submarine fan. The Burrell Creek Formation is unconformably
overlain to the south and west by Neo-Proterozoic Birrindudu Basin
sediments including the Depot Creek Sandstone (Tolmer Group), which is
essentially flat lying and comprises a pink, fine to coarse, rippled quartz
sandstone and thin conglomerate lenses and beds. Cretaceous Mullaman
Beds (sandy clay, sandstone and conglomerate) unconformably overlie
the Depot Creek Sandstone in the south west corner of the project area
(refer to figures in report).
Lower greenschist facies metamorphism, associated with the Top End /
Barramundi Orogeny (1870-1800 Ma), deformed the Burrell Creek
Formation into a series of upright, tight, north trending and south

plunging folds in the northern area at the Adelaide River mine whereas in
the central area the folds are gently north plunging. The fold hinges and
parasitic folds on the limbs of regional folds are the principle host for
mineralisation.
There are no mapped igneous rocks in the project area, but it is probably
that the area is under-pined by intrusions(s) of the Cullen Batholith.
Established mineralisation in EL31886 includes uranium and gold, but
there are base metal anomalies also evident. The gold reported is of a
similar style to the Howley Mineral Field, which includes the Cosmo
Howley mine operated by Kirkland Lakes Resources Ltd, 20km to the
southeast. In that field, a string of gold deposits is located along the crest
of the Howley Anticline and forms an intermittent line of lode extending
for 24km that strikes NNE. The gold is generally either coarse and visible
or as inclusions in sulphides within discordant quartz veins, faults and
shear-zones sub-parallel to F3 anticlinal axes, often as stacked saddle
reefs. Most lodes in that district trend NNE and have steep dips.
Core also believes that there is potential for stratiform gold deposits
associated with graphitic and iron-rich sediments (BIF horizons) that
occur with an absence of quartz veining. The gold is present in submicroscopic particles of arsenopyrite and lesser pyrite. Known deposits
include Cosmopolitan Howley and the Golden Dyke. At Mount Bonnie and
Iron Blow the gold deposits are uniquely zinc dominant and more
polymetallic with sphalerite-galena-aresenopyrite-pyrite-chalcopyritepyrrhotite-tetrahedrite (held by PNX Metals Ltd). These are also a valid
target in EL31886, as implied by the base metal flavor of some of the
prospects.
Gold mineralisation in the Pine Creek Orogen is mostly orogenic in nature
and appears associated with events related to the Cullen Batholith and
mineralisation can occur some distance from the granite-sedimentary
contacts.
The Pine Creek Orogen also contains world-class uranium deposits in the
Kakadu Field, Rum Jungle Field and the Adelaide River Field (largely
contained in EL31886). They are all hosted in metasedimentary rocks, and

Relationship between
mineralisation widths
and intercept lengths

JORC Code explanation

• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the
exploration results including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from
the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should
clearly explain why this is the case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade
results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used
for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of
such aggregations should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.

Commentary
all have a common spatial association with the overlying sandstone
unconformity (Kombolgie Sandstone or Tolmer Group). They are
universally classified as “Unconformity style”. Uranium occurs as primary
oxides and secondaries within shears and veins, often as shallow-dipping
sheets. Grades can be spectacular, but overall are lower than the
equivalents in the Athabasca Basin, Canada.
• All the known historic drillholes are tabulated in the body of this report.
• No new drilling has taken place by Core Lithium.
• Coordinates are GDA94 zone 52.

• Drill assay intercepts quoted in Core’s report are directly from the
published Company reports. The gold cutoff used appears to be 0.1 g/t,
which is acceptable for exploration results.
• The poly-metallic intersection in ARDDH002 was calculated by Core
Lithium Ltd over the sulphidic interval, which is best reflected by a 400
ppm Cobalt cutoff.
• The original assay is used in all cases (i.e., Au1).
• Length weighted averages are utilised.
• No top-cut applied.
• No metal equivalents have been used.
• Mineralisation orientations have not been determined.

JORC Code explanation
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there
should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole length,
true width not known’).
• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.

• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples
– size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics;
potential deleterious or contaminating substances.
• The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests for lateral
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions,
including the main geological interpretations and future drilling
areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.

Commentary

• Refer to Figures and Tables in the release.

• Only drill-hole assay intercepts that are significant have been reported.
• Rockchip assays reported from Possum and Arum Prospects in the table
in the report body are only samples >0.5 g/t Au, >200 ppm Co, >200 ppm
Cu, >100 ppm Ni, >200 ppm Pb, >100 ppm U and >200 ppm Zn. These are
considered reasonable thresholds for anomalous exploration results. This
accounts for 57 of the 530 samples in the geolocated rockchip dataset
from within the bounds of EL31886.
• All meaningful and material data has been reported either within this
JORC Table or the body of the report.

• Core Lithium has not yet undertaken any on-ground exploration.
• Future work is likely to include locating historic local grids, multi-element
rockchip sampling of known prospects and along-strike corridors, multielement soil sampling within data-gaps where there is geological support
for mineralisation, airborne spectral data acquisition, and ground
electrical surveys at known prospects.
• Drilling will be considered once prospects have been accurately located
and targeting has been carried out.
