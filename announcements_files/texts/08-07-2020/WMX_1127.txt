Golden Age currently supplements the baseload free-milling open pits and is an
important source of transitional cashflow for the next 15 months.

•

Golden Age and the adjacent Lennon zone will continue to provide mine feed for Stage
1 and 2 of the Wiluna expansion.

•

The drilling at Golden Age and Lennon continues to enhance the free-milling operation
ahead of the Stage 1 expansion.
Milan Jerkovic, Wiluna Mining’s Executive Chair commented: “These results continue to deliver
on our strategy to extend the Golden Age zone and surrounding areas. We aim to sustain or
increase production and improve transitional cashflow over the next 15 months ahead of
sulphides production from September 2021”.

ASX Announcement

For personal use only

8 July 2020

Wiluna Mining Corporation Limited (“Wiluna Mining” or “the Company”) is pleased to report
further results from drilling at Golden Age and Lennon within the Wiluna Mining Centre. This
drilling programme commenced in November 2019 to delineate Mineral Resources and provide
further transitional feed to the free milling operations. Lennon and Golden Age are part of the
northern mining area at Wiluna (Figure 1) and will continue to be mined during Stage 1 and 2
expansion phases.

Figure 1: Map of the Wiluna Mining Centre. Stage 1 Sulphide Expansion mining areas are shown
coloured.

Mine Extension Drilling

The Company continues to extend the Golden Age orebody, which is a non-refractory quartzreef style of deposit located at the Wiluna Mining Centre (Figure 1). Latest results are from a
further 11 holes for 2,086m drilled at Golden Age Lower and the adjacent Lennon target (Figure
2).

For personal use only

Increasing Mineral Resources and conversion to Reserves is key to the Company’s 24-month,
five-point strategy to:
1. Strengthen the balance sheet
2. Increase operational cash flow
3. Transition to include gold concentrate production
4. Expand production, and
5. Undertake exploration and feasibility studies to fully develop a more than 250kozpa, long
life gold operation.
For further information on the transition and the Stage 1 and Stage 2 expansion please see the
latest company presentation released to the ASX on 1 July 2020 and ASX release dated 23
December 2019.
The Wiluna Mining Centre is divided into four geographical areas (Figure 1), centred on
underground mine portals and planned mining areas of the Stage 1 Sulphides Expansion plan.
Golden Age and Lennon are within the Wiluna North Mine Area and are accessed from the
Bulletin decline.
In November 2019, the Company quantified Exploration Targets at the Golden Age mine (see
ASX release dated 13 November 2019). The Company has progressively completed drilling at
the Golden Age Footwall and Golden Age Main targets, (see ASX release dated 4 June 2020)
with resource modelling currently in progress. Drilling is now focussed on the Golden Age Lower
and Lennon targets, with results to follow in due course (Figure 2).
Golden Age Lower
Drilling is now focussed on the Golden Age Lower zone. Together with previously reported
results (see ASX release dated 4 June 2020) including GARD0112: 7.1m @ 7.47g/t, these results
show that high-grade Golden Age mineralisation remains open for a considerable distance
below the current workings (Figure 3).
Drilling is ongoing and further results will be reported when they become available. Latest
results from the Golden Age Lower programme are positive, confirming Golden Age reef
mineralisation of similar tenor to previous holes:

Lennon
A resource development programme at the Lennon target has also commenced. Lennon sits in
the immediate footwall below Golden Age and mine development has commenced to access
the mineralisation (Figure 2). Lennon mineralisation comprises multiple high-grade partially
refractory sulphide shears, with economic gold recoveries expected through the existing freemilling circuit and as part of the proposed staged expansion of the Wiluna Mining Operations
processing plant at Wiluna.

Stage 1 Sulphide Mineral Resource Development

Mineral Resource development drilling is ongoing at the Wiluna Mining Centre, with
outstanding results recently published (see ASX release dated 26 May 2020 and 23 June 2020).
The Company is focussed on infill and extensional drilling to methodically increase the
geological confidence in the Mineral Resources that will underpin Stage 1 production. The
Company’s objective is to develop and maintain four years of underground Ore Reserves in
front of production through progressive infill drilling and conversion of our very large Mineral
Resource base.
The Wiluna Mine is a large gold system with greater than 10 million ounces of gold endowment
including current Mineral Resources and historical production. With a combined open pit and
underground Mineral Resource of 35.5Mt @ 3.90g/t for 4.45Moz, including 2.2Moz (49%) in
the Inferred category, there are significant opportunities to define additional Mineral Resources
and life-of-mine extensions.

Wiluna Mining has used NQ2 with ½ core sampling.
Wiluna Mining’s sampling procedures are in line with standard
industry practice to ensure sample representivity. Core samples
are routinely taken from the right-hand-side of the cut line.
Face samples are taken across the quartz vein, with sample
intervals matched to varying intensity of mineralisation as
indicated by shearing and sulphides.
Historical core sampling is at various intervals so it appears that

this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation

was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’).
In other cases more explanation may be required, such

sampling was based on geological observations at intervals
determined by the logging geologist.
At the laboratory, samples were crushed to <2mm in a Boyd
crusher, split, and pulverized via LM5 to 90% passing 75µm to
produce a 50g charge for fire assay. Historical assays were
obtained using either aqua regia digest or fire assay, with AAS
readings.
Wiluna Mining analysed DD samples using ALS laboratories in
Perth. Analytical method was Fire Assay with a 50g charge and
AAS finish. GAGC* holes and face samples were also analysed
at the Wiluna Mine site laboratory for preliminary results (not
reported here), pulverized in an LM5 bowl to produce a 30g
charge for assay by Fire Assay with AAS finish.

Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample

• Wiluna Mining data reported herein is oriented NQ core.
• Historical drilling data contained in this report includes RC, AC

For Wiluna Mining DD drilling, recovery is measured by the
drillers and Wiluna Mining geotechnicians and recorded into
the digital database. No significant issues are noted with sample
recovery as drilling is all in competent fresh rock. For historical
drilling, recovery data for drill holes contained in this report has
not been located or assessed, owing to incomplete data
records. Database compilation is ongoing.
For DD drilling, sample recovery is maximised by the use of
short drill runs (typically 1.5m).
For Wiluna Mining drilling, no such relationship was evaluated
as sample recoveries were generally excellent. Face sampling is
generally prone to higher-grade bias, though bias effects were
not studied on these samples as no face sample results are
reported here. Data was not available for historical drilling.
Drill samples have been logged for geology, alteration,
mineralisation, weathering, geotechnical properties and other
features to a level of detail considered appropriate for
geological and resource modelling.
Logging of geology and colour for example are interpretative
and qualitative, whereas logging of mineral percentages is

For core samples, Wiluna Mining uses half core cut with an
automatic core saw. Samples have a minimum sample width of
0.1m and maximum of 1.2m to match geological boundaries,
though typically 1m intervals were selected. A cut line is
routinely drawn at an angle 10 degrees to the right of the
orientation line. Where no orientation line can be drawn, where
possible samples are cut down the axis of planar features such
as veins, such that the two halves of core are mirror images.
For historical drilling sampling techniques and preparation are
not known. Historical core in storage is generally half core, with
some quarter core remaining; it is assumed that half core was
routinely analysed, with quarter core perhaps having been used

sampled (visibly barren zones not sampled, though some quartz
vein intervals have been left un-sampled), with a minimum
sample width of 0.3m and maximum of 1.2m, though typically
1m intervals were selected.
Boyd <2mm crushing and splitting is considered to be standard
industry practice; each sample particle has an equal chance of
entering the split chute. At the laboratory, >3kg samples are
split so they can fit into a LM5 pulveriser bowl. At the
laboratory, >3kg samples are split 50:50 using a riffle splitter so
they can fit into a LM5 pulveriser bowl.
Field duplicates were collected approximately every 20m down
hole for Wiluna Mining holes. With a minimum of one duplicate
sample per hole. Analysis of results indicated good correlation
between primary and duplicate samples. Core duplicates are
obtained at the Boyd coarse crush stage.
Riffle splitting and half-core splitting are industry-standard
techniques and considered to be appropriate. Note comments
above about samples through ‘stope’ intervals; these samples
don’t represent the pre-mined grade in localized areas.
For historical drilling, field duplicates, blank samples and
certified reference standards were collected and inserted from
at least the early 2000’s. Investigation revealed sufficient
quality control performance. No field duplicate data has been
located or evaluated in earlier drilling. Field duplicates were
collected every 20m down hole for Wiluna Mining holes.
Analysis of results indicated good correlation between primary
and duplicate samples.
Sample sizes are considered appropriate for these rock types
and style of mineralisation and are in line with standard
industry practice.
Fire assay is a total digestion method. The lower detection limits
of 0.01ppm is considered fit for purpose. For Wiluna Mining
Exploration drilling, ALS completed the analyses using industry
best-practice protocols. ALS is globally-recognized and highlyregarded in the industry. Historical assaying was undertaken at
Amdel, SGS, and KalAssay laboratories, and by the on-site
Agincourt laboratory. The predominant assay method was by
Fire Assay with AAS finish. The lower detection limit of 0.01ppm
Au used is considered fit for purpose.
Samples analysed at ALS and with Au > 0.3g/t are also assayed
for As, S and Sb using ICPAES analysis (“ME-ICP41”)
No geophysical tools were required as the assays directly
measure gold mineralisation. For Wiluna Mining drilling, downhole survey tools were checked for calibration at the start of the
drilling programme and every two weeks.
For Wiluna Mining drilling certified reference material, blanks
and duplicates were submitted at approximately 1:20. Check
samples are routinely submitted to an umpire lab at 1:20 ratio.
Analysis of results confirms the accuracy and precision of the
assay data. Blanks and quartz flushes are inserted after logged
high grade core samples to minimise and check for smearing,
analyses of these results typically shows no smearing has
occurred. It is understood that previous explorers great Central
Mines, Normandy and Agincourt employed QAQC sampling,
though digital capture of the data is ongoing, and historical
QAQC data have not been assessed. Results show good
correlation between original and repeat analyses with very few
samples plotting outside acceptable ranges (+/- 20%).
Wiluna Mining’s significant intercepts have been verified by
several company personnel, including the database manager
and geologists.
Twinned holes were not drilled in this programme, however,

Wiluna data represents a portion of a large drilling database
compiled since the 1930’s by various project owners.
Data is stored in Datashed SQL database. Internal Datashed
validations and validations upon importing into Micromine
were completed, as were checks on data location, logging and
assay data completeness and down-hole survey information.
QAQC and data validation protocols are contained within
Wiluna Mining’s manual “Wiluna Mining Exploration Manual
2020”. Historical procedures are not documented.
The only adjustment of assay data is the conversion of lab nonnumeric code to numeric for estimation.
All historical holes appear to have been accurately surveyed to
centimetre accuracy. Wiluna Mining’s drill collars are routinely
surveyed using a DGPS with centimetre accuracy.
Grid systems used in this report are Wil10 local mine grid and
GDA 94 Zone 51 S. Drilling collars were originally surveyed in
either Mine Grid Wiluna 10 or AMG, and converted in Datashed
to MGA grid.
An accurate topographical model covering the mine site has
been obtained, drill collar surveys are closely aligned with this.
Away from the mine infrastructure, drill hole collar surveys
provide adequate topographical control.
Wiluna Mining’s exploration holes are generally drilled 25m
apart on sections spaced 25m apart along strike.
Using Wiluna Mining’s drilling and historical drilling, a spacing
of approximately 12.5m (on section) by 20m (along strike) is
considered adequate to establish grade and geological
continuity. Areas of broader drill spacing have also been
modelled but with lower confidence.
The mineralisation lodes show sufficient continuity of both
geology and grade between holes to support the estimation of
resources which comply with the 2012 JORC guidelines
Samples have been composited only where mineralisation was
not anticipated. Where composite samples returned significant
gold values, the 1m samples were submitted for analysis and
these results were prioritized over the 4m composite values.
RC drill holes were generally orientated perpendicular to
targets to intersect predominantly steeply-dipping north-south
or northeast-southwest striking mineralisation, though
underground DD holes were in places drilled obliquely; true
widths are shown in the significant intercepts table.
The perpendicular orientation of the drill holes to the structures
minimises the potential for sample bias.

Information

A summary of all information material to the understanding of
the exploration results including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that
the information is not Material and this exclusion does not
detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent
Person should clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be
stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high
grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the
procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some
typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent
values should be clearly stated.
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.

The Golden Age drilling is located wholly within M53/6,
M53/95, M53/69, M53/468, M53/200 and M53/32. The
tenements are owned 100% by Matilda Operations Pty Ltd., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Wiluna Mining Corporation Ltd.
Williamson is located on granted Mining License M53/797,
subject to the Sale Agreement with Salt Lake Potash where
Wiluna Mining retains 100% of the gold rights. Lake Way is a
registered heritage site and Wiluna Mining operates to the
Williamson Mine under Heritage Act Section 18 Ministerial
approval. Regent is located on granted Mining License
M53/1098 owned 100% by Kimba Resources Pty Ltd., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Wiluna Mining Corporation Ltd.
The tenements are in good standing and no impediments exist.
Franco Nevada have royalty rights over the Wiluna Mine
mining leases of 3.6% of net gold revenue. Native Title holders
own an additional 0.75% royalty on gold production from the
Regent tenement.
Modern exploration has been conducted on the tenement
intermittently since the mid-1980’s by various parties as
tenure changed hands many times. This work has included
mapping and rock chip sampling, geophysical surveys and
extensive RAB, RC and core drilling for exploration, resource
definition and grade control purposes. This exploration is
considered to have been successful as it led to the eventual
economic exploitation of several open pits during the late
1980’s / early 1990’s, and underground mining until 2013. The
deposits remain ‘open’ in various locations and opportunities
remain to find extensions to the known potentially economic
mineralisation. In 2010, Apex Minerals drilled and confirmed
the depth extensions of Golden Age around the 600 level.
The gold deposits are categorized as orogenic gold deposits,
with similarities to most other gold deposits in the Yilgarn
region. The deposits are hosted within the Wiluna Domain of
the Wiluna greenstone belt.
See Appendix 1.

If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported,
there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole
length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported. These should include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting
of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be
reported including (but not limited to): geological observations;
geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test
results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating
substances.
The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral
extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).

available drill sites. Drill holes reported herein have been
drilled as closed to perpendicular to mineralisation as possible.
In some cases due to the difficulty in positioning the rig close
to remnant mineralisation around open pits this is not
possible. True widths are included in the significant intercepts
table.
See body of this report.

For Wiluna Mining drilling, either all significant assay results
are reported or the hole is listed as ‘no significant intercepts’.
Full reporting of the historical drill hole database of over
80,000 holes is not feasible.
Other exploration tests are not the subject of this report.

Follow-up resource definition drilling is likely, as mineralisation
is interpreted to remain open in various directions.
Diagrams are provided in the body of this report.
