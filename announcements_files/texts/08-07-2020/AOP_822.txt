ASX ANNOUNCEMENT
By e-lodgement
8th July 2020

Reconnaissance drilling hits 6m @ 9.72g/t Au
at Lake Rebecca

Apollo Consolidated Limited (ASX: AOP) (“Apollo”, “the Company”) is pleased to report new Reverse
Circulation (RC) drilling results from its 100%-owned +1Moz1 Lake Rebecca Gold Project located
150km east of Kalgoorlie in the West Australian goldfields.

Highlights:
➢ Ongoing shallow reconnaissance and infill exploration drilling along the Duchess to Cleo
structural corridor has delivered more significant new gold intercepts, each of which requires
follow-up work:
➢ 6m @ 9.72/t Au (including 1m @ 49.8g/t Au) in RCLR0579 located ~2km north east of the
Duchess deposit. Hit is supported by silica alteration and oxidised sulphides and is open for
500m to the south and at least 600m to the north. Immediate follow-up drilling planned
➢ Widespread shallow gold intercepts and anomalism in a 200m step-out traverse at Cleo,
including 15m @ 0.93g/t Au*, 2m @ 2.10g/t Au, 5m @ 1.14g/t Au* and 12m @ 0.77g/t Au*
within 118m @ 0.48g/t Au EOH in RCLR0581. Cleo mineralisation is hosted in mafic rocks and
represents a new style of gold in the Project area
➢ Wide zones of mineralisation found well outside maiden Mineral Resources1 in NE part of
Duchess, with 30m @ 0.82g/t Au* in RCLR0590, 21m @ 0.70g/t Au* in RCLR0592, 16m @
0.82g/t Au* in RCLR0589, as well as numerous other gold hits
➢ Drilling results demonstrate potential for new Mineral Resources in broader Project area.
Drilling continues designed to expand on February 2020 maiden combined in-situ Mineral
Resources1 of 27.1 million tonnes at 1.2g/t Au for 1.035 million ounces of gold (at a 0.5g/t Au
cut-off & constrained within A$2,250/oz optimised pit shells)

* intercept includes 1 or more composite sample, which will now be resampled at 1m intervals

DRILLING PROGRESS UPDATE
This release details further significant gold assay results from ongoing RC drilling at the Lake
Rebecca Gold Project, which is located 150km ENE of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia (Figure 1).

For personal use only

An additional 21 shallow RC exploration drill holes for 2,900m are reported here, all of which were
drilled between the Duchess deposit and Cleo, and are part of the exploration drilling program planned
for this structural corridor. All hole details and significant intercepts are presented in Table 1 and hole
locations in Figure 1.
1. Reconnaissance Drilling NE of Duchess
Reconnaissance-style RC drilling along a magnetic and structural corridor ~2km NE of the Duchess
deposit (Figure 1) has hit 6m @ 9.72/t Au (including 1m @ 49.8g/t Au) from 42m in RCLR0579, the
westernmost hole of a traverse of three drill holes (RCLR0577-579).

Figure 1. Regional location of Lake Rebecca Gold Project (LHS) and location of Rebecca, Duchess and Duke
gold deposits on aeromagnetic imagery (RHS), showing labelled drill holes announced in this release as
stars and significant results in yellow test boxes. Image also has outline of $A2,250 optimised pit shells and
all RC and/or diamond drill collars1,2, colour-coded for peak downhole gold values. Refer to Notes 1-3 for details
of Mineral Resource reporting and previous RC and diamond drilling activities.

The RCLR0579 intercept contains the highest gold grades seen at Lake Rebecca outside the
Rebecca deposit itself and corresponds to logged silica alteration and oxidised sulphides within a
broad zone of >0.10g/t Au anomalism. Whilst additional drilling is required to confirm dip, strike is
interpreted to be north-south and is open for 500m to the south and at least 600m to the north.

For personal use only

Two RC holes on a traverse 500m to the south of this intercept also drilled through alteration and
sulphides, returning 6m @ 0.59g/t Au from 44m and 2m @ 1.37g/t Au from 66m in RCLR0576, within
a 60m wide zone of >0.10g/t Au anomalism.
The new high-grade intercept lies 680m north of strong results reported previously including 25m @
1.23g/t Au* followed by 15m @ 1.40g/t Au* in RCLR0560 (see ASX: AOP 13th May 2020 “RC Drilling
Finds New Gold Mineralisation At Lake Rebecca”).
The combined drilling along this magnetic/structural corridor suggests excellent potential for
significant new gold mineralisation and this target will continue to receive priority reconnaissance
and infill drilling.
2. Cleo Prospect
Two exploration traverses 200m apart in the soil-covered Cleo prospect area (Figure 1) have
continued to locate compellingly wide zones of gold anomalism, including the strongest results to date
in drill hole RCLR0581. This hole hit multiple shallow composite intercepts including 15m @ 0.93g/t
Au* from 25m, 2m @ 2.10g/t Au from 61m, 5m @ 1.14g/t Au* from 75m and 12m @ 0.77g/t Au*
from 83m within 118m @ 0.48g/t Au EOH (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Cleo step-out exploration cross-section 6641820N (looking north) showing intercepts RCLR0580 and
RCLR581. Note widespread gold anomalism in both holes on this section.

Drill hole RCLR0580 located 100m to the east also hit wide anomalism, including 5m @ 0.73g/t Au*
from 40m, 5m @ 0.64g/t Au* from 50m, and 4m @ 2.04g/t Au from 96m. On the second traverse
220m south (RCLR0582-584), drill hole RCLR0583 intersected a composite hit of 5m @ 3.27g/t Au*
from 25m.

* intercept includes 1 or more composite sample, which will now be resampled at 1m intervals

Cleo appears to be mainly hosted by mafic rocks (as compared to diorite and granodiorite host rocks
elsewhere) and therefore opens a significant area for first-pass exploration, including the
complex fold area north of Duchess, and the northern extensions of the Cleo magnetic trend (Figure
1). The Company will continue to explore Cleo and strike extensions for new mineralised positions.

For personal use only

3. Duchess Step-out Drilling
RC drill holes RCLR0588 to RCLR0594 inclusive were drilled to test step-out or exploration positions
to the north east of Duchess. These holes returned wide gold intercepts and strong anomalism that
sits well outside the reported Duchess in-situ pit-constrained maiden Mineral Resources1 (180,000oz
@ 1.0g/t Au) (Figure 2).
Intercepts are interpreted to be close to true width and include:
❖ RCLR0590: 30m @ 0.82g/t Au* from 70m within an anomalous zone of 150m @ 0.42g/t Au
EOH from 35m (Figure 3);
❖ RCLR0592: 21m @ 0.70g/t Au* from 134m within an anomalous zone of 75m @ 0.45g/t Au
EOH from 105m (Figure 4);
❖ RCLR0589: 16m @ 0.82g/t Au* from 94m; and
❖ RCLR0591: 10m @ 0.70g/t Au* from 120m within an anomalous zone of 104m @ 0.35g/t Au
EOH from 40m.

The new results demonstrate the scale and potential volume of the mineralised ‘cell’ at Duchess,
which contains multiple west-dipping mineralised structures showing strong deformation, alteration
and disseminated sulphides. Extensional and step-out RC drilling continues in the Duchess area.

Discussion
Ongoing drilling continues to investigate under-drilled portions of the Lake Rebecca Project, with
these results extending gold mineralisation at Duchess and Cleo and confirming an exciting
new exploration surface NE of Duchess. The 6m @ 9.72g/t Au intercept in RCLR0579 contains
the highest gold grades seen at Lake Rebecca outside the Rebecca deposit, and will receive
detailed follow-up testing to build on this discovery.

Current Work

For personal use only

An additional 22 shallow step-out and strike exploration RC holes have now been drilled around the
Duchess Mineral Resource1. Samples are being delivered in batches to the laboratory for analysis
and will continue to be reported as results come to hand. At least one RC rig is scheduled to keep
working around the three key deposits throughout the second half of the year, while diamond drilling
will continue to test high-grade step-down exploration targets at the Rebecca deposit.
Table 1. Drilling details this release. All intercepts calculated at a 0.50g/t lower cut off and allowing
for a maximum of 2m internal dilution. Intercepts marked * include one or more 2-5m composite
sample which will now be resampled at 1m intervals

collected.
• To minimize contamination and ensure an even split, the
cone splitter is cleaned with compressed air at the end of
each rod, and the cyclone is cleaned every 50m and at
the end of hole, and more often when wet samples are
encountered
• RC holes where groundwater can not be controlled are
abandoned, and later extended where necessary via NQ
diamond ‘tails’
• >95% of all drill samples in fresh rock profile were dry
• Sample quality and recovery was generally good using the

• Logging is mostly qualitative
• Each entire drill hole was logged
• While drill core samples are being geologically logged,
they will not be at a level of detail to support appropriate

• All core trays and RC chip trays are photographed for
future geological reference

•

RC composite sampling was carried out where site
geologist decided material was less likely to be
mineralised. In these intervals samples were spear‐
sampled directly from the split bulk sample, to make up a
2‐3kg 2‐5m composite sample

•

Where composite samples are taken, the sample spear is
inserted diagonally through the bulk sample bag from top
to bottom to ensure a full cross‐section of the sample is
collected. This technique is considered an industry
standard and effective assay cost‐control measure

•

Bulk bags for each metre are stored for future assay if
required.

•

All samples were dry and representative of drilled
material

•

Certified Reference Standards inserted every ~40
samples, 1 x duplicate sample submitted per drillhole

•

Sample sizes in the 2‐3kg range are considered sufficient
to accurately represent the gold content in the drilled
metre at this project

•

Diamond core was cut in half lengthways and half-core
lengths up to 1.5m in length were submitted for assay

•

Remaining half core is retained in core trays for future
study
• Core samples were collected from the Project area
by staff, and delivered to Genalysis Kalgoorlie (WA)
where they were crushed to ‐2mm, subset, riffle split
and pulverised to ‐75um before being sent to
Genalysis Perth for 50g charge assayed by fire
assay with AAS finish
• RC chip samples were collected from the Project
area by staff, and delivered to SGS Kalgoorlie (WA)
where they were crushed to ‐2mm, subset, riffle split
and pulverised to ‐75um before being assayed for
50g charge assayed by fire assay with AAS finish,
Lab code FA505.

•

Quality control procedures adopted consist in the
insertion of laboratory standards approx every 40m and
one duplicate sample per hole and also internal
Genalysis/SGS laboratory checks. The results
demonstrated an acceptable level of accuracy and
precision

• Collar located using a Garmin GPS with an accuracy ~3m
• Data are recorded in AMG 1984, Zone 51 projection.
• Topographic control using the same GPS with an
accuracy <10m
• Drillhole details supplied in body of announcement

• Diamond drillholes were completed on lines 25-50m apart
to test below existing mineralised RC or diamond
intercepts, with intercept spacing on structures >80m
apart.
• RC drilling was completed at 25m & 50m line spacing to
infill and extend interpreted mineralisation
• The drill program was designed to follow-up existing
nearby mineralisation and the spacing of the program is
considered suitable to provide bedrock information and
geometry of the lode structures targeted. Further infill
drilling may be required to establish continuity and grade
variation around the holes
• Assays are reported as 1m samples, unless otherwise
indicated in tables in the attaching text
• Drillholes were oriented along AMGZ51 east-west.
• Drill sections intend to cut geology close to right-angles of
interpreted strikes. Completed drillholes intersected target
mineralisation in the expected down-hole positions.
• Rock contacts and fabrics are interpreted to mostly dip
west at close to right angles to the drill hole. Mineralised
intervals reported vary from almost 100% true width to
~40% true width, depending on local changes in the
orientation of mineralised lodes
