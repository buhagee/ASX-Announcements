NOVATTI EXITS SENDFX INVESTMENT
▪

Sale of investment realises $900,000 additional growth funds

Novatti Group Limited (ASX:NOV) (Novatti or Company) advises that, by mutual
agreement, it has exited its investment in cross-border payments provider, SendFX, and
ended its provision of ongoing technology and compliance services.
SendFX was launched in early 2019 as a new cross-border payments platform, targeting
individuals and small businesses. Novatti was a seed investor in SendFX, providing equity
and debt funding together with technology and compliance services. The investment was
announced to the ASX in March 2019.
Under its exit, Novatti will receive $900,000 in cash representing payment for the buy-back
of Novatti’s shareholding, plus repayment of loan funds from an aggregate cash investment
by Novatti of $400,000. The funds will be paid in three equal tranches over six months. The
$900,000 realised will add to Novatti's funds available for growth, including those raised in
the capital raise of $10.2 million announced on 29 June 2020.
Novatti’s Managing Director, Peter Cook, said: “Novatti has strong inhouse expertise and a
creative culture that enables us to commercialise high-growth ideas. Novatti is now funded
to drive outstanding growth in this COVID-19 payments world.”
