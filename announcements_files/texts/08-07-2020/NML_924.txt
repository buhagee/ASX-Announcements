HIGH-GRADE GOLD ASSAYS EXTEND RESOLUTION LODE

For personal use only

DIAMOND DRILLING CONTINUES AT STAWELL CORRIDOR GOLD PROJECT, VICTORIA

•

Resolution Lode continues to deliver strong, consistent grades of gold mineralisation in an ongoing
9,000m expansion diamond core drilling program.

•

Highlight new intersections (not true widths) include:
▪

2.9m @ 6.2 g/t Au from 187.3m within a broader zone of 9.4m @ 2.6 g/t Au in RD023

▪

2.0m @ 9.9 g/t Au from 235.8m within a broader zone of 11.9m @ 1.8 g/t Au in RD024

▪

1.0m @ 20.8 g/t Au from 358.6m within a broader zone of 10.3m @ 2.2 g/t Au in RD024

•

Second zone of gold mineralisation identified approximately 50m west of main gold zone.

•

Gold mineralisation confirmed from surface to beyond 300m depth and remains open down-plunge.

•

The style and geometry of gold mineralisation is similar to the multi-million ounce Magdala gold
deposit, on-strike 20km further north, where gold has been mined from surface to 1.6km depth.

•

Drilling is targeting a potential Mineral Resource by scoping the down-plunge extents of shallow gold
mineralisation.

•

A further 5,000m of diamond core drilling remains to be completed with drilling operations to
continue through winter and moving towards a 24/7 basis.

Navarre Minerals Limited (ASX: NML) (Navarre or the Company) is pleased to report further significant gold assay
results from an ongoing 9,000m diamond drilling program on the 100%-owned Resolution Lode prospect, located
210km west of Melbourne and 20km south of Stawell’s 4Moz Magdala Gold Mine in Victoria (Figures 1 & 2).
The latest drilling results from Resolution Lode includes strong, consistent grades of gold mineralisation within a
quartz-rich structure that continues from surface and extends beyond 300m depth, remaining open down-plunge.
This release captures results from the latest four diamond holes completed at Resolution Lode and follows the
earlier release of eight diamond holes reported to the ASX on 27 April 2020.
Navarre’s Managing Director, Geoff McDermott, said:
“Our ongoing diamond drilling program at Resolution Lode is continuing to deliver consistently strong grades of
high-grade gold mineralisation from within a well-defined lode channel extending from surface to beyond 300m
depth. It remains open down-plunge.”
“The geometry and style of gold mineralisation at Resolution Lode is similar to the nearby 4Moz Magdala gold
deposit, where gold has historically been mined from surface to 1.6km depth, indicating the potential for a similar
large gold deposit at Resolution Lode.”
“Step-out drilling is planned to continue through winter to evaluate the size, continuity and tenor of gold
mineralisation at Resolution Lode in order to see if it has what it takes to deliver Victoria’s next major gold deposit.
We look forward to sharing the next round of results as we continue our drilling strategy.”

NEW DIAMOND DRILLING RESULTS – RESOLUTION LODE
Navarre is executing a 9,000m diamond drilling program (~45% complete) to scope the depth potential of the
1.6km long Resolution Lode discovery with the aim of delivering a maiden mineral resource in early 2021.
To date 12 holes have been completed for approximately 4,000m of diamond core drilling at Resolution Lode
(Figures 2 & 4). The drill program is testing the continuity and extent of previously intersected shallow gold
mineralisation by:
1. drilling beneath areas of our best air-core drill results to establish geometry, tenor and plunge direction
of the gold mineralisation; and then
2. scoping the dimensions of the mineralisation using a nominal 100m (N-S) by 80m (vertical) infill and stepout drill pattern.

Diamond holes have been drilled at angles designed to cut across the interpreted sub-vertical orientation of the
mineralised structures from either the western (hangingwall) or eastern (footwall) side of the projected gold
zones, depending on surface access availability.

For personal use only

•

These intercepts complement previously reported drill intercepts* from Resolution Lode (see NML ASX releases
of 1 December 2016, 24 April 2017, 15 May 2017, 28 May 2018 & 27 April 2020):
•

18.7m @ 7.1 g/t Au1 from 196.3m, including 5.7m @ 11.6 g/t Au in drill hole RD006

2.4m @ 4.4 g/t Au from 293.7m in drill hole RD018

•

3.1m @ 3.1 g/t Au from 204.3m in drill hole RD019

*Note: all drill intercepts are reported as down-hole intervals.

The new gold results are interpreted to occur in two steeply west-dipping structures that cut across, at an acute
angle, an interbedded package of meta-sediments and thin basalt flows within 100m of the main Irvine basalt
dome (Figure 3).
The mineralisation is characterised by significant quartz veining (or quartz tension vein arrays), occurring with
strong chlorite alteration containing minor amounts of sulphides (typically less than 3%), including arsenopyrite +
pyrite + pyrrhotite and rare visible gold (see photo, Figure 5). Zones of anomalous gold are typically elevated in
arsenic, an important pathfinder metal in most Victorian gold deposits.
The higher-grade gold mineralisation has been interpreted to occur within two lode channels or shoots that
plunge gently towards the south and remain open down-plunge (see Figure 4). The South Shoot, with more drill
information, has approximate dimensions of up to 300m in height, 500m down-plunge (open to the south) and

between 1.5 – 5m in width. The North Shoot has been defined by shallow air-core drilling and has a lower tenor
of grade when compared to the South Shoot. Deeper diamond core drilling is planned for the North Shoot later
this year. The gold shoot geometry appears analogous to that of the Magdala gold deposit (Figure 6).
Interpretation of the results of the latest four diamond holes indicates:

South Shoot – drill holes RD023 and RD024 continue to highlight the significant, consistent and repeatable
gold mineralisation developing down-plunge in the main structure of the South Shoot (Figures 4 & 5). A
second, deeper intercept in RD024 of 1.0m @ 20.8 g/t Au within a broader interval of 10.3m @ 2.2 g/t Au,
approximately 50m west of the main structure, is highlighting the potential for multiple mineralised
surfaces at Resolution Lode. This is the highest grade and most southerly drill intercept outside of the
main structure and will be the focus for further drill testing.
Hole RD025A, drilled to test the full width of strong gold mineralisation returned in abandoned drill hole
RD025 (7.7m @ 5.6 g/t Au within a broader interval of 18.7m @ 3.4 g/t Au – see NML ASX release of 27
April 2020), deviated 20m higher than planned but has helped constrain the upper boundary of the South
Shoot to within a 20m interval (see Figure 4). Although RD025A failed to replicate the drill path of RD025,
it does support the recent recognition of south plunging gold shoots at Resolution Lode.
North Shoot – drill hole RD022 appears to have drilled beneath the interpreted southerly plunge of
shallow gold mineralisation intersected in previous air-core drilling. The hole, however, ended in arsenic
and chlorite alteration returning an anomalous assay interval of 5.5m @ 0.5 g/t Au. As this mineralisation
occurs east of the main gold zone, the Company is intending to re-enter and extend RD022 to test the
extents of this anomalous gold zone. This drilling is expected to be completed later this month.

In summary, interpretation of the diamond results at Resolution Lode indicates:
•

gold mineralisation occurs in two higher-grade shoots;

•

the gold shoots plunge gently to the south;

•

gold mineralisation extends to beyond 300m depth and remains open;

•

gold tenor is relatively uniform, averaging between 4 and 6 g/t below the base of oxidation;

•

the width of gold mineralisation generally ranges between 1.5m and 5m;

•

a second significant sub-parallel zone of gold mineralisation has been identified approximately 50m west
of the main gold zone; and

•

the drilling results returned to date continue to demonstrate continuity, predictability and robustness of
the mineralised system at Resolution Lode.

NEXT STEPS – RESOLUTION LODE
•

Transition drilling to 24/7 operations to increase diamond core productivity, subject to any health and
safety considerations resulting from government restrictions due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

•

Extend RD022 by drilling through anomalous gold and arsenic zone.

•

Complete program of expansion diamond drilling at South Shoot through winter using an existing allweather access track.

•

Resume diamond drill testing at North Shoot in October following conclusion of winter rains.

•

Estimate a potential Mineral Resource by Q1 2021.

Approximately 5,000m of diamond drilling remains to be completed with results expected to be reported in
batches of between 4 and 6 drill holes following receipt of assays and interpretation of geology.

STAWELL GOLD CORRIDOR BACKGROUND

For personal use only

The Company is searching for large gold deposits in an extension of a corridor of rocks that host the 5Moz
Stawell and 1Moz Ararat goldfields – “The Stawell Gold Corridor” (Figure 1). A key feature of major gold deposits
along the Stawell Gold Corridor is that they are hosted in meta-sediments on the margins of Cambrian basalt
domes. The 4Moz Magdala gold deposit at Stawell is the best example of this style of mineralisation.
Navarre has identified seven basalt dome structures within the Company’s 60km long tenement package to date.
The regional potential of the Stawell Gold Corridor is considered significant by the Company as demonstrated by
Navarre’s discoveries at the Irvine and Langi Logan prospects where gold is proximal to large basalt dome
structures.
The Irvine basalt dome is Navarre’s most advanced prospect. Previous drilling has confirmed extensive shallow
gold footprints at the Resolution and Adventure lodes with a combined strike length of 2.9km along the eastern
contact of the Irvine basalt dome (Figure 2). Navarre has been testing the depth extents of the gold shoots at
both lodes down to approximately 300m below surface through targeted diamond drilling programs.
The Langi Logan basalt dome is the next major prospect for Magdala-style mineralisation south of the Irvine
basalt dome within the Stawell Corridor Gold Project (Figure 1). It consists of the Langi Logan North, Langi Logan
Central and the Langi Logan South Cambrian basalt domes with a combined 12km strike length and occurs in an
area of significant historical Deep Lead production (133,000oz of gold recorded). Approximately 80% of the
project area is covered by post-mineralisation Newer Volcanics ranging up to 30m in thickness.

About Navarre Minerals Limited:

Navarre Minerals Limited (ASX: NML) is an Australian-based resources company that is creating value from a
portfolio of early to advanced stage gold projects in Victoria, Australia.
Navarre is searching for gold deposits in an extension of a corridor of rocks that host the Stawell (~five million
ounce) and Ararat (~one million ounce) goldfields (The Stawell Corridor Gold Project). The discovery of
outcropping gold on the margins of the Irvine basalt dome and high-grade gold in shallow drilling at Langi Logan
are a prime focus for the Company. These projects are located 20km and 40km respectively south of the operating
4Moz Stawell Gold Mine.
The high-grade Tandarra Gold Project is located 50km northwest of Kirkland Lake Gold’s world-class Fosterville
Gold Mine, and 40km north of the 22 million-ounce Bendigo Goldfield. Exploration at Tandarra, in Joint Venture
with Catalyst Metals Limited (Navarre 49%), is targeting the next generation of gold deposits under shallow cover
in the region.
The Company is searching for a high-grade gold at its St Arnaud Gold Project. Recent reconnaissance drilling has
identified gold mineralisation under shallow cover, up to 5km north from the nearest historical mine workings,
which the Company believes may be an extension of the 0.4Moz St Arnaud Goldfield.
The Company is also targeting volcanic massive sulphide, epithermal and porphyry copper-gold deposits in the
Stavely Arc volcanics. The Project area captures multiple polymetallic targets in three project areas including
Glenlyle , Eclipse and Stavely. All properties are currently 100% owned. Stavely (EL 5425) is subject to a farm-in
agreement where Stavely Minerals Limited may earn an 80% interest by spending $0.45M over 5 years.
At the Jubilee Gold Project, 25km southwest of LionGold’s Ballarat Gold Mine, the Company is undertaking a
systematic exploration program targeting extensions and repetitions of historically mined transverse quartz reefs
that bear similarity to the high-grade Swan – Eagle system at Fosterville.

Diamond Core Drilling
The diamond drill core samples were selected on
geological intervals varying from 0.2m to 1.6m in length.
All drill core was routinely cut in half (usually on the right
of the marked orientation line) with a diamond saw and
submitted for analysis.
Sample representivity was ensured by a combination of
Company Procedures regarding quality control (QC) and
quality assurance/ Testing (QA). Certified standards and
blanks were routinely inserted into assay batches.

Diamond Core Drilling
Pre-collars were drilled to solid bedrock using an HWT
(114.3mm) drill bit followed by diamond coring with a
diameter of 63.5mm (HQ) and 50.6mm (NQ2).
Diamond drilling of HQ3 (triple-tube) was undertaken to
ensure maximum core recovery.
All drill core was orientated with a Reflex ACT III core
orientation tool then continuously marked with a line
while on an angle iron cradle.
Diamond Core Drilling
All diamond core was logged capturing any core loss, if
present, and recorded in the database.
All drill depths are checked against the depth provided on
the core blocks and rod counts are routinely carried out by
the driller.
Core recovery for the areas sampled was generally good.
Geological logging of samples followed Company and
industry common practice. Qualitative logging of samples
included (but was not limited to); lithology, mineralogy,
alteration, veining and weathering.
All logging is quantitative, based on visual field estimates.
Detailed diamond core logging, with digital capture, was
conducted for 100% of the core by Navarre’s geological
team.

Half core was sampled from NQ and HQ diameter drill
core.
Company procedures were followed to ensure subsampling adequacy and consistency. These included (but
were not limited to), daily workplace inspections of
sampling equipment and practices.
Blanks and certified reference materials are submitted
with the samples to the laboratory as part of the quality
control procedures.
No second-half sampling has been conducted at this stage.
The sample sizes are appropriate to correctly represent
the sought after mineralisation.
Analysis for gold is undertaken at ALS Perth, WA by 30g
Fire Assay with an AAS finish to a lower detection limit of
0.01ppm Au using ALS technique Au-AA25.
Bulk-leach analysis for gold is also undertaken by ALS
Perth, WA on selected samples from the Au-AA25 method.
The bulk leach method utilises a ~2kg sample using ALS
technique Au-AA15. Navarre does this to check for the
effects of nuggety gold particularly in know regions
containing this effect.
ALS also conduct a 35 element Aqua Regia ICP-AES
(method: ME-ICP41) analysis on each sample to assist
interpretation of pathfinder elements.
A review of certified reference material and sample blanks
inserted by the Company indicate no significant analytical
bias or preparation errors in the reported analyses
Internal laboratory QAQC checks are reported by the
laboratory and a review of the QAQC reports suggests the
laboratory is performing within acceptable limits.
Samples are verified by database consultants (Geobase)
and Navarre geologists before importing into the drill hole
database.
No twin holes have been drilled by Navarre during this
program.
Primary data was collected for drill holes using a Geobase
logging template on a Panasonic Toughbook laptop using
lookup codes. The information was sent to a database
consultant for validation and compilation into a SQL
database.
Reported drill results were compiled by the Company’s
Exploration Manager and verified by the Managing
Director.
No adjustments to assay data were made.
All maps and locations are in UTM Grid (GDA94 zone 54).
All drill collars are initially measured by hand-held GPS
with an accuracy of +3 metres. On completion of program,
a contract surveyor picks-up collar positions utilising a
differential GPS system to an accuracy of +0.02m.
A topographic control is achieved via use of DTM
developed from a 2005 ground gravity survey measuring
relative height using radar techniques.
Down-hole surveys were taken every 30m on the way
down to verify correct orientation and dip then multishots taken every 6m on the way out of the drill hole.
Variable drill hole spacings are used to test targets and are
determined from geochemical, geophysical and geological
data together with historic mining information.
Drilling reported in this program is of an early exploration

Exploration is at an early stage and, as such, knowledge on
exact location of mineralisation, in relation to lithological
and structural boundaries, is not accurately known.
The drill orientation is attempting to drill perpendicular to
the geology and mineralised trends previously identified
from earlier drilling. Due to the early stage of exploration
it is unknown if the drill orientation has introduced any
sampling bias. This will become more apparent as further
drilling is completed.

Irvine Gold Project
• Centaur Mining & Exploration held licence EL 1224 in the
1980s and conducted surface mapping, and shallow RAB
drilling along road verges in proximity to the Irvine
prospect. The main focus of their exploration activities
became the Mt Ararat base-metal sulphide deposit further
to the SW.
• CRA Exploration held licences EL 2651 & EL 3429 (which
were amalgamated into EL 3450) in the early 1990s. It was
recognised that basalt lavas and associated metasediments at the northern end of the field held gold
potential of the Stawell-style (which itself was relatively
poorly understood at that time). CRA drilled 12 RC holes
(average 48m depth) and 2 diamond holes in the Irvine
area. This work was initially focused along two northtrending outcrops of ironstone to the west of the Irvine
Basalt, now referred to as the Great Western Trend (or
Stawell Fault). Significant gold grades of 4m @ 0.88 g/t
Au (RC92AA021 from 32m) and 2m @ 2.84 g/t Au
(RC92AA027 from 24m) were recorded. Mapping and rock

chip sampling across the entire Ararat Goldfield was also
undertaken at this time with several >1 g/t Au results
obtained.
A single diamond drill hole following up two shallow RC
holes on the western flank of the Irvine Basalt generated a
0.5m @ 7.2 g/t Au intersection from 86.5m in a “classic
Magdala footwall sequence” of high arsenopyrite and
pyrrhotite from meta-sediments in DD92AA254. This was
the only hole to pass through the Irvine basalt contact.
From 1995 to 1996, under Joint Venture with CRAE,
Stawell Gold Mines undertook exploration which included
4 lines of shallow vertical air-core drilling across the trend
of the Irvine Basalt. Owing to weather and drill
penetration difficulties, no basalt contacts were
intersected in any SGM holes and no significant gold
results were obtained. The air-core program helped
deduce the broad outline of the western basalt contact. A
few selected trays from CRAE’s regional drill program are
held by the Geological Survey of Victoria in their core farm
facility in Werribee.
Navarre has reviewed and assessed all previous
exploration results available in the public domain.

Geology

•

Deposit type, geological setting and style of
mineralisation.

•

The project areas are considered prospective for the
discovery of gold deposits of similar character to those in
the nearby Stawell Gold Mine, particularly the 4Moz
Magdala gold deposit. The Stawell Goldfield has produced
approximately 5 million ounces of gold from hard rock and
alluvial sources. More than 2.3 million ounces of gold
have been produced since 1980 across more than 3
decades of continuous operation.

Drill hole
Information

•

A summary of all information material to the
understanding of the exploration results
including a tabulation of the following
information for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation
above sea level in metres) of the drill hole
collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
If the exclusion of this information is justified on
the basis that the information is not Material and
this exclusion does not detract from the
understanding of the report, the Competent
Person should clearly explain why this is the case.

•

Reported results are summarised in Figures 3-4 and Tables
1-2 within the main body of the announcement.
Drill collar elevation is defined as height above sea level in
metres (RL)
Drill holes were drilled at an angle deemed appropriate to
the local structure and stratigraphy and is tabulated in
Tables 1 & 2.
Hole length of each drill hole is the distance from the
surface to the end of hole, as measured along the drill
trace.

In reporting Exploration Results, weighting
averaging techniques, maximum and/or
minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material
and should be stated.
Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short
lengths of high grade results and longer lengths
of low grade results, the procedure used for such
aggregation should be stated and some typical
examples of such aggregations should be shown
in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.

•

Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for
any significant discovery being reported These
should include, but not be limited to a plan view
of drill hole collar locations and appropriate
sectional views.

•

Refer to diagrams in body of text

Balanced
reporting

•

Where comprehensive reporting of all
Exploration Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both low and high
grades and/or widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.

All drill hole results received and pending have been
reported in this announcement.
No holes are omitted for which complete results have
been received.

For personal use only

Criteria

•
•

These relationships are particularly important in
the reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with
respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature
should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths
are reported, there should be a clear statement
to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width
not known’).

Commentary
•

•

Diamond Core Drilling
Estimated true widths are based on orientated drill core
axis measurements and are interpreted to represent
between 30% to 70% of total downhole widths.

Other
substantive
exploration
data

•

Other exploration data, if meaningful and
material, should be reported including (but not
limited to): geological observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk
samples – size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk density,
groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.

•

All relevant exploration data is shown in diagrams and
discussed in text.

Further work

•

The nature and scale of planned further work
(e.g. tests for lateral extensions or depth
extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of
possible extensions, including the main
geological interpretations and future drilling
areas, provided this information is not
commercially sensitive.

•

Navarre will continue testing of the basalt flanks at the
Irvine basalt dome using air-core and diamond drilling
techniques.
Areas of positive drill results are expected to be followed
up with infill and expansion diamond drilling.
