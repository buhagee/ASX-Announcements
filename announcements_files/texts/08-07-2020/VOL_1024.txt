Dear Todd
Victory Offices Limited ‐ request for trading halt
Pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 17.1, Victory Offices Limited (ASX:VOL) (Victory Offices) requests a trading
halt of Victory Offices securities effective from the commencement of trading today, 8 July 2020.
In accordance with ASX Listing Rule 17.1, Victory Offices provides the following information to the ASX:
a) the trading halt is sought pending an announcement by Victory Offices in relation to the timing
of settlement of the capital raise announced to the market on 4 June 2020. The trading halt is
necessary to prevent trading taking place on an uninformed basis and to allow the settlement of
the capital raise to take place in an orderly manner;
b) Victory Offices requests the trading halt to remain in place until the earlier of such time as it
makes an announcement to the market concerning the settlement of the capital raise and the
commencement of trading on 10 July 2020; and
c) Victory Offices is not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be granted or of any
other information necessary to inform the market or ASX about the trading halt.
Please contact me if there are any queries regarding this request.
Yours faithfully
