ASX Announcement
Not for release to US wire services or distribution in the United States
8 July 2020

Results of Security Purchase Plan
Vicinity Centres (Vicinity, ASX:VCX) advises the completion of its non-underwritten Security Purchase Plan
('SPP'), raising approximately $32.6 million. This follows Vicinity's $1,200 million underwritten institutional
placement completed on 2 June 2020.
The SPP announced by Vicinity on 1 June 2020 closed on Monday 6 July 2020, with approximately
2,400 applications received from eligible securityholders.
Vicinity confirms it will accept all valid SPP applications in full and expects to issue approximately
22.6 million new fully paid stapled securities (‘New Securities’).
The New Securities will be issued at $1.44 per New Security, which represents a 2% discount to the volume
weighted average price of Vicinity securities traded on ASX over the five trading days up to, and including,
Monday 6 July 2020, of $1.47 per security.
The New Securities are expected to be issued on Monday 13 July 2020 and to commence trading on ASX on
Tuesday 14 July 2020. Holding statements are expected to be dispatched on Wednesday 15 July 2020 and
refunds for application monies (due to invalid applications or rounding to parcel amounts) will be processed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPP.
The New Securities will, from their date of issue, rank equally with existing Vicinity securities on issue.
Authorisation
The Company Secretary has authorised that this document be given to ASX.
