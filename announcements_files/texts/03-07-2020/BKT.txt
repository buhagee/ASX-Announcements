About Black Rock Mining

For personal use only

Black Rock Mining Limited is an Australian based company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:BKT). The Company
currently has a 100% interest in the Mahenge Graphite Project (the "Project") located in Tanzania. The Project has a JORC
compliant Mineral Resource Estimate of 212m tonnes at 7.8% TGC. It also has Ore Reserves of 70m tonnes at 8.5% TGC. The
Ore Reserves support a mine life of up to 350k tonnes of graphite per annum for a reserve life of 16 years. Since the release of
the Mineral Resource Estimate, the Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects
the Mineral Resource Estimate.
In October 2018, the Company released a Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) for the Project, which was based on strong
customer demand. This DFS was enhanced in July 2019, and demonstrates exceptional financial metrics including:
•

Low Capex: Lowest peak capital expenditure of US$116M for phase one*;

•

High Margin: AISC margin of 63.1%;

•

Low Technical Risk: Substantial pilot plant operations run of 110 tonnes; and

•

Superior Economics: IRR of 44.8% with NPV10 of US$1.16bn (A$1.65bn**).

Following release of the Enhanced DFS in July 2019, the Company confirms that it is not aware of any new data or information
that materially affects the results of the Enhanced DFS and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning
the estimates in the relevant market announcements continue to apply and have not materially changed.
In February 2019, the Company announced receipt of its mining license for the DFS Project. In May 2019, the Company
announced it had substantially allocated planned production with up to 255k tonnes per annum of graphite committed to sale
by year three of production, through Pricing Framework Agreements.
The Company is currently progressing financing discussions and detailed engineering with a view to commencing construction
of the Project.
