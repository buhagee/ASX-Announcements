BRYAH GOLD DRILLING PROGRAM UNDERWAY

HIGHLIGHTS:
•

2,000 metres of RC drilling underway to test the Windalah Gold prospect and a high priority
EM conductor target north of Peak Hill gold mine

•

At the Windalah Prospect, Bryah recently intersected high-grade gold mineralisation, reporting
12 m @ 4.32 g/t Au from surface, including 2 m @ 17.19g/t Au (hole BBRC049)

Bryah Resources Limited (“Bryah” or “the Company”) is pleased to advise that it has commenced
its gold drilling program in the Bryah Basin, of Western Australia, with approximately 2,000 metres
of reverse circulation (RC) planned initially.
The RC drilling program will initially target the following 2 areas:
1.

The high priority Windalah gold prospect (see Figure 1), where 2018 and recent drilling
returned exceptional high-grade gold intersections, including:
• 12 m @ 4.32 g/t Au from surface, including 2 m @ 17.19 g/t Au from 3 m (BBRC049)1
• 5 m @ 6.62 g/t Au from 79 metres, including 1 m @ 15.15 g/t Au from 82 m (BBRC019)2
• 3 m @ 6.69 g/t Au from 145 metres, including 1 m @ 10.52 g/t Au from 146 m (BBRC020)2
At least seven drill holes will be drilled at Windalah in this initial program.

2.

A significant electromagnetic (EM) conductor target located 7km north of the Peak Hill Gold
Mine3 and 65km west of Sandfire Resources’ DeGrussa Mine (see Figure 1), where the
Company plans to drill and case 2 holes to a depth of approximately 300 metres.
In 2018 this conductor was identified by an airborne Versatile Time-Domain Electromagnetic
(VTEM™ Max) survey and also confirmed by a Moving Loop Electromagnetic (MLEM) ground
survey. The Company intends to undertake down hole EM surveys of the drillholes to assist in
follow-up exploration.

Managing Director, Neil Marston said:
“This drilling program is the first of several drilling campaigns we plan to undertake over the
remainder of 2020 to test some of our excellent gold and copper targets.
The recent gold results reported from our drilling at Windalah will be followed up with at least seven
RC holes in this program. We also plan to drill at least two deep holes at the high order EM target
north of the historic Peak Hill gold mine.
