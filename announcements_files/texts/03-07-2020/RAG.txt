QUARTERLY ACTIVITIES REPORT
30 June 2020

Ragnar Metals Limited (Ragnar or Company) presents this Quarterly Activities Report for the quarter ended 30 June
2020.
EXISTING PROJECTS
Environmental Permit Received for the Swedish Tullsta Nickel Project
On 23 April 2020, Ragnar was pleased to advise shareholders that the Company has received correspondence from
the Swedish Department of Nature Conservation stating that the County Administrative Board at Sala has granted an
exemption from the Off-Road Driving Act. This Environmental Permit paves the way for conducting diamond drilling
and geophysical measurements within the Berga Nr1 tenure at the Company’s Swedish Tullsta Nickel Project.

Highlights included:
•

An Environmental Permit to operate off-road in the County of Sala has been granted by the Swedish
Department of Nature Conservation and the County Administrative Board

•

The Environmental Permit grants Ragnar an exemption from the Off-Road Driving Act and grants permission
to undertake the planned drilling and geophysical works within the forests and fields at the Tullsta Nickel
Project

•

The exemption applies until 08/04/2022 and gives Ragnar the right to travel within the marked Berga Nr1
survey works area which was submitted to the Inspectorate of Mines

•

Landholders have been served the Work Plans and should there be no objections, the work plan becomes valid
and Inspectorate of Mines will issue the final Works Permit

•

Once the final Works Permit is issued, the planned field trip to valid the drill sites and meet landowners will
be re-scheduled once global COVID-19 travel restrictions are lifted

•

Planned drilling is currently postponed until international travel is permitted to reconvene

The Environmental Permit has been granted until 8 April 2022 giving Ragnar the right to travel, diamond drill and
undertake geophysical surveys within the marked Berga Nr1 tenement survey works area as shown at Figure 1.

Figure 1: Permitted area of works centred over the Granmuren Nickel Deposit at Tullsta. The Works area covers all the planned drilling as
shown on the right image. The Granmuren nickel mineralisation (purple model) and existing drill holes (blue traces) into the mineralised zone
are shown, and the new larger IP Chargeability model is shown by the green model. Planned drill holes (red traces) will test the northwest
trend, the depth potential to the north and south, as well as the developing untested southern anomaly.

Final Swedish Tenement Granted and Full Work Permits Received
On 19 May 2020, Ragnar was pleased to advise shareholders that the Company has received correspondence from the
Swedish Inspectorate of Mines granting the Tullsta nr8 permit which was applied for in February 2020. It was the only
missing tenement within the Tullsta tenement package (other than excised town and water reserves within Tullsta nr7
permit). The granting of this permit now gives Ragnar Metals 100% coverage of the Tullsta Project area which now
covers a total area of 136.44km2 (Figure 2 and Table 1).

Highlights included:
•

Tullsta nr8 permit now granted giving Ragnar Metals 100% coverage of the Project Area

•

Tullsta nr8 adjoins the Berga nr1 permit which contains the Granmuren Nickel Mineralisation

•

The final Works Permit has also been granted by the Inspectorate of Mines to operate within Berga nr1 permit
and commence the planned activities

•

The Works Permits and Environmental Permits apply until 08/04/2022 giving Ragnar the right to travel, drill
and undertake geophysical surveys within the marked Berga Nr1 survey works area

•

Ragnar will undertake a pre-drilling field trip to validate the targets, inspect the planned drill sites and meet
landowners once global COVID-19 travel restrictions are lifted

•

The planned drilling activities are currently postponed until international travel is permitted to reconvene

Berga nr1 permit. The granting of Tullsta nr8 closes the gap in Ragnar’s tenement package.

Tullsta nr8 adjoins the Berga nr1 permit which contains the Granmuren Nickel Mineralisation (Figure 3). The
Granmuren Nickel Mineralisation is projected to extend at depth into the Tullsta nr8 area (Figure 1) and for Ragnar
Metals, this is a crucial tenement to have been granted given the anticipated outcomes from the planned drilling at
the Granmuren Nickel deposit which is situated in the adjoining Berga nr1 tenure.

Figure 3: Recently granted Tullsta nr8 tenure(centre) closes the gap between granted permits Berga 1(right) and Tullsta nr7 (left). The
approved Work Permit area (blue) abuts the permit boundaries and covers the Granmuren mineralisation and the recent IP-Resistivity
anomalies which are scheduled for drill testing.

CORPORATE
Payments to Related Parties
As outlined in the attached Appendix 5B (section 6.1), during the quarter approximately $11K in payments were made
to related parties and their associates for director salaries, consultancy fees, superannuation and other related costs.

Does the entity expect that it will continue to have the current level of net operating
cash flows for the time being and, if not, why not?

Answer: The Company is in exploration and evaluation phase and as a result, expects to
have negative operating cash flows for the time being.
2.

Has the entity taken any steps, or does it propose to take any steps, to raise further
cash to fund its operations and, if so, what are those steps and how likely does it
believe that they will be successful?

Answer: Yes. The Company manages its cash flow through monthly budgeting and
forecasting. In addition, the Company has demonstrated its ability to secure funds
when required and is confident that it will be able to continue to do so.
3.

Does the entity expect to be able to continue its operations and to meet its business
objectives and, if so, on what basis?

Answer: Yes. There is sufficient cash available to continue meeting business objectives in a
short-term and further funding has been planned for medium-term and long term
purposes.
