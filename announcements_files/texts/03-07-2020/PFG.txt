Prime Financial Group Ltd (Prime – ASX: PFG)
3 July 2020

Our focus during this period has been to ensure that we continuously provided support and advice on how
best to manage through these challenging times by providing comprehensive, proactive, timely and regular
advice on what to do to protect and how best to navigate the various support packages provided by the state
and federal government.
The rapid-fire nature of the change required our team to be ever present, to quickly evaluate and promptly
act, this we feel we have done and continue to do very well. Furthermore, as part of our support for clients
and the community Prime also created Business Owner, Wealth Management and Superannuation Forums
for our clients and people in our clients’ networks to attend free of charge to share important business and
financial information and strategies. We are not seeking to overstate the importance of our programs and
approach, rather acknowledge the responsibility we felt to provide as much support as possible to as many
people as possible.

The Team
Continuing to keep 100% of our team together and focused during a period of significant disruption and
uncertainty has been an important part of our future and business continuity strategy and ability to support
our clients during a period of very high demand for services. The team’s remuneration (outside of the Board)
was not affected during this period even though a number of Prime’s peers saw a reduction in remuneration
for staff and lay-offs. Our team remains our most important asset, and their ongoing commitment, flexibility
and resilience in extraordinary circumstances cannot be overstated and we reiterate our thanks.

The Prime Board
During the onset of COVID-19 the Prime Board met regularly, led by our Interim Chairman Mr Tim Carroll
and Prime Co-founder and Executive Director Mr Peter Madder along with myself. During this period, the
Prime Board worked closely with the leadership team to formulate and manage a comprehensive plan to
maintain Prime’s momentum, support our team and clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Part of
this plan incorporated the Board reducing its remuneration by 10% from April to June 2020.
Tim Carroll extended his tenure as Interim Chairman providing continuity and leadership and this support
has been valuable and appreciated. Having successfully navigated and positioned Prime strongly to weather
future challenges and maximise opportunities for growth, Tim Carroll is resigning from his role as a Director
of Prime, effective today, to focus his attention on his other business interests. At the same time, Peter
Madder is taking this opportunity to announce his succession and retirement as an Executive Director of
Prime, effective end of August 2020, moving to a role of special adviser in a part-time capacity from 1
September 2020. Peter Madder’s vision for Prime and entrepreneurial spirit have been the hallmark of the
Prime culture which will continue as we grow Prime for the benefit of all stakeholders. The Board thanks both
Tim Carroll and Peter Madder for their leadership and vision.
Today I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Matt Murphy and Mr Tim Bennett to the Prime Board
as Executive Directors. Matt Murphy leads Prime’s Accounting & Business Advisory division, a material
contributor to Prime’s earnings, and is personally an accomplished business adviser and accountant. Matt
has been with Prime since 2016 and is a member of the leadership team and is an important part of Prime’s
vision as ‘One Connected’ professional services firm. I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome Matt Murphy
to the Board today, for more information on Matt Murphy please click here.
