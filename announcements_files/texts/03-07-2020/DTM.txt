DART MINING DISCOVERS NEW MINERALISATION STYLES IN HISTORIC
HIGH-GRADE GOLDFIELDS
BACKGROUND
The Sandy Creek and Tallandoon goldfields are known for historical production of
exceptionally high-grade gold from narrow lodes (up to 3.5 kg/t). Located 60 km south
of Albury-Wodonga in Northeast Victoria, detailed mapping and sampling by Dart
Mining geologists have redefined the exploration and mineralisation model for these
goldfields. Exploration focus has now shifted to higher volume, disseminated goldsulphide mineralisation in altered granites adjacent to high-grade narrow-vein gold
mineralisation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

For personal use only

Dart Mining NL (ASX:DTM) (“Dart Mining” or “the Company”) is very pleased to report exceptional results from
recent mapping and sampling activities at the Company’s wholly owned Sandy Creek Gold Project near Eskdale,
Northeast Victoria. Rock chip and soil sampling has provided evidence for multiple zones of gold mineralisation
associated with altered granite at structural intersections on the periphery of the Yabba Granite. A workplan has
been approved for ~1,000m of percussion drilling across five targets at Sandy Creek, to be commenced in
September this year after the first phase drill program at the company’s Buckland Gold project is complete. This
document provides a detailed outline of the history, geological setting, and recent work by Dart Mining to
introduce the Sandy Creek Gold Project to the market. Although technical in nature this report serves to act as
an “introductory primer” document for all interested parties.
Introduction
The Sandy Creek and Tallandoon goldfields jointly cover a 26 by 5km area, hosting gold and minor tin
mineralisation (Figure 1). Alluvial gold was initially discovered in 1854 along Sandy Creek with approximately
5km of the creek mined for both tin and gold. Hardrock gold mineralisation was identified and became the focus
of historic development within the Sandy Creek area in 1879, with 83 recorded historic reef workings.
Development progressed further south, with the discovery and subsequent development of the Tallandoon
goldfield in 1896, with 94 recorded gold workings, in addition to three antimony mines and nineteen tin workings
(Figure 1). Both fields were noted for exceptionally high gold grades within quartz veins and associated felsic
dykes.
Previous explorers focused on the narrow quartz vein mineralisation style typical of historic workings of the
Sandy Creek and Tallandoon goldfields. Dart Mining has revised this approach, conducting prospect mapping
and sampling across the field demonstrating that gold mineralisation is associated with hydrothermal alteration
of the Yabba Granite (Figure 2) and extends into a metasedimentary roof pendant above the granite body.
Detailed structural mapping has identified an orthogonal fault system that has focused gold mineralisation on
north-south and northwest-southeast oriented structures (Figure 3). Chip sampling across historic mine
workings have identified several zones of high-grade quartz-free gold (Figure 2a) and disseminated sulphide
mineralisation associated with altered granites, proximal to the contact with the Yabba Granite (Figure 2b & 2c).
On this basis, the Sandy Creek Goldfield is interpreted to consist of several zones of altered granite that are
particularly strongly mineralised along the intersection of orthogonal fault systems.
Applying results from soil sampling, geological mapping and rock chip sampling, Dart Mining has focused their
attention on five prospective drill targets in the Sandy Creek field. Preliminary surface sampling and mapping at
Tallandoon suggests a similar structural control across the distribution of gold-bearing structures, however
zones of altered granite are less prevalent, and high-grade silica-sulphide gold mineralisation in quartz veins
appears to be broader, and in association with strongly enriched antimony, silver, lead and zinc (Figure 2d, Table
1).

names of notable historic mine workings are labelled.

Records indicate that 160,000 oz of gold was produced from 11,000 tonnes of ore between 1877 – 1915 from
Sandy Creek reefs (Lanzer, 1988). Included amongst this are reported head grades of 3562 g/t from the A1 Lloyds
mine (Wodonga & Towong Sentinel, 1888), although compiled contemporary newspaper reports indicate
average grade across the field was 77 g/t. Similarly, the Tallandoon Goldfield is estimated to have produced
100,000 oz of gold between 1886 – 1915, although it was sporadically worked until 1945, largely for antimony
production, with 33.5 tons of antimony produced from the Carry On mine (Oppy et al., 1995; Phillips, 2010).
Included amongst this is a reported crushing of 1470 g/t from the Tallandoon Goldfield (101.5 oz from 5 tons
ore, Mystery [Tallandoon] Reef; Wodonga & Towong Sentinel, 1911), and the discovery of a 51 oz (1.4kg) gold
nugget (Quandong Reef; Border Morning Mail & Riverina Express, 1913). The average grade produced from the
Tallandoon field was 95 g/t Au, as compiled from newspaper reports.

EXPLORATION OVERVIEW
Mapping and Sampling
Through detailed literature research and a comprehensive field campaign, the Company is confident that the
detailed mapping program by Dart Mining geologists has identified and located all historical workings in the
Sandy Creek Goldfield. Mapping and sampling have redefined the mineralisation model for the Sandy Creek
Goldfield, abandoning the narrow-vein, orogenic gold mineralisation model held by previous explorers in favour
of a disseminated gold-sulphide mineralisation in a roof-pendant system. Field mapping has determined that
most mineralisation in the goldfield is directly adjacent or proximal to the contact between the Omeo
Metamorphic Complex and the Yabba Granite (Figure 3). Gold mineralisation predominantly occurs along NWand NNE-trending faults and becomes particularly enriched where these fault systems intersect, providing
numerous targets for drill testing.
Regional soil sampling, chip sampling, and geological mapping of prospects (methodology and analytical
technique are outlined in Table 1 Appendix 2) have identified multiple drill targets, supporting Dart Mining’s
belief that Sandy Creek has excellent potential to host substantial gold mineralisation in hydrothermally altered
granites. The concurrent application of these methods to test the potential for large-scale gold mineralised
systems has been essential to construct a robust understanding of the mineralisation style present at the Sandy
Creek Gold Project.

Sandy Creek Goldfield

For personal use only

Rock chip sampling across workings and mineralised structures in the Sandy Creek Goldfield has identified three
gold mineralisation styles. These include narrow-vein quartz/free gold, disseminated sulphide Au and As (± Sb,
Pb) with rare free gold in altered granite, and Au (± Ag) mineralisation in sheared pegmatites. Of these
mineralisation styles, disseminated sulphide-hosted gold is the dominant style, often in occurrence with a
narrow-vein, heavily mineralised core which has been played out in most instances by historic mining activity.
The 122 g/t Au chip sample from Ellis Antimony and the 140 g/t Au mullock grab sample from the Morning Star
working is testament of these narrow-vein quartz grades, in addition to the 0.5m chip sample at 28.2 g/t at
O’Dell’s. Chip samples indicate that altered granites bearing abundant arsenopyrite commonly assay between
1–15 g/t, although in some instances can assay at 20+ g/t.
Petrographic examination of samples from Sandy Creek show that all samples represent variably
hydrothermally-altered, coarse-grained granites (Ashley, 2020). At least two phases of mineralisation are
apparent in the geochemistry and the mineralogy of altered granite. All samples sent for petrographic
examination display moderate to intense hydrothermal alteration effects, with microstructures indicating
penetrative deformation prior to, or concurrent with hydrothermal alteration (Ashley, 2020). Arsenopyrite is
locally abundant in samples, forming up to ~24%, with visible gold in two of seven samples (Ashley, 2020).
Altered granites from Sandy Creek demonstrate characteristics consistent with both orogenic gold systems and
intrusion-related gold. Dart Mining favours an orogenic, epizonal mineralisation model for primary gold
mineralisation at Sandy Creek and Tallandoon based on geochemical and structural relationships. However,
preliminary geochemical and petrographic examination shows the Yabba Granite to be relatively reduced and
fractionated, with considerable greisen alteration evident in mineralised granite samples, suggesting a possible
intrusion-related gold affinity, and providing greater scope for expanded exploration of the Sandy Creek project.

Figure 3: Detailed geological and structural map of the northern Sandy Creek goldfield showing selected peak gold grades
from altered granite sampled either in, or around historic workings. A complete compilation of grades from all samples is
included in Appendix 3. The Conness (513050E, 5979650N) and Wildcat (513935E, 5975650N) workings are just outside the
boundaries of this map.

The Honeysuckle, I.X.L East, Shamrock and O’Dell’s mines have been identified as the principal exploration
targets through field mapping, rock chip and soil sampling by Dart Mining geologists (Figure 4). Historically, the
Honeysuckle Mine was worked to a depth of 60m before flooding became problematic and was abandoned.
Between 1886 and 1903 the Honeysuckle Mine recorded production of 4267.5 oz from 3395 tons of ore, giving
an average grade of 39.3 g/t. Very little information is available for the I.X.L East working, as the adit was
abandoned around 1905 before reaching its target. However, the drive intercepts a considerable thickness of
sheared, sericite-altered metasediments hosting stringers of altered granite and fine arsenopyrite, providing
consistent low-grade gold values and generating a composite intercept of 14m @ 1.46 g/t (true width; Figure
4B).
Production records for Shamrock are particularly poor, and there was at least 1942 oz produced from 1502 tons
of ore between 1881 and 1945, giving an average grade 40.4 g/t Au. However, the Shamrock mine is a
considerably larger development than the other workings considered here, with the lower level being driven in
the 1930’s–1940’s, yet only a single 8 ton crushing reported. Abundant and considerable lengths of altered
granite are apparent in the Shamrock, with wall samples along the lower level giving a composite grade of 4.0
g/t over 20m. However, with few cross-cuts, it is uncertain how deep mineralisation extends. A 2.5m sample at
12.65 g/t Au indicates that mineralisation extends at least 2+ m into the wall rock.

The O’Dell’s mine was noted as having average head grades of 400–570 g/t Au (Dunn, 1888), and was reopened
in 1979–1996, generating some renewed interest in exploration of the Sandy Creek and Tallandoon fields.
Around the end of production from O’Dell’s mine in 1996, grades up to 43.5 g/t and 89.4 g/t remained in wall
rock, and a representative ore sample assayed at 27 g/t (Wilson, 1996). Altered granite was sampled in an ore
pass and in the foot of a stope (0.8m @ 14.4 g/t; Fall grab @ 15 g/t; 4.5m @ 5.4 g/t; 1.5m @ 3.64 g/t Au). The
primary stopes of the O’Dell’s mine had focused on narrow vein quartz and sericite-scorodite altered sediment,
with samples returning 1.0m 12.65 g/t, 1.5m @ 3.02 g/t, 1.1m @ 2.88 g/t and 0.5 m @ 28.2 g/t Au.
Multi-element analysis of rock chip samples has demonstrated that As is an appropriate pathfinder element for
Au in the Sandy Creek area, with a strong correlation between Au and As, both in soils and altered granite.
Arsenic is applied as the primary pathfinder element in soil sampling, with background values typically between
5–15 ppm As, and ranging up to 1709 ppm. To date, 1331 soil samples have been collected across the Sandy
Creek Goldfield. Structural mapping and gridded soil sample transects sampled at 25x10m resolution across the
O’Dell’s and Shamrock prospects indicate that mineralisation is dominantly developed along NW-oriented
structures at the O’Dell’s prospect and along NE-oriented faults at the Shamrock prospect.

Tallandoon Goldfield

For personal use only

Preliminary examination of the Tallandoon Goldfield shows that mineralisation is dominantly associated with
quartz reefs, with abundant arsenopyrite, sphalerite, common galena and occasional stibnite. Like Sandy Creek,
an orthogonal, NNE and WNW fault system has focused mineralisation on these structures. The Ellis Antimony
and the Lawrence workings had largely collapsed, however assays from mullock and a small accessible shaft
show enticing results for gold (including 0.2m @ 122 g/t), silver and base metals (Pb, Sb, Zn), and significant
workings await further exploration. The Tallandoon and Quandong mines have historically shown that these
structures are mineralised across widths of up to 1m, to depths more than 200m from surface and across strike
lengths greater than a kilometre.

Planned Exploration
Drilling is required to further progress and evaluate the potential mineralisation in the Sandy Creek Goldfield.
Multiple targets have been identified, and a workplan for 980m of drilling has been approved for first pass RAB
or RC drilling of the primary targets identified. A preliminary phase of drilling is planned to test the potential size
distribution of altered granite bodies across O’Dell’s, Shamrock, I.X.L East, Morning Star and Honeysuckle
prospects. These targets have been identified given their grade, proximity to existing roads and comparatively
shallow depth to prospective ore bodies. Surface exploration is continuing at Tallandoon, with a focus on
structural mapping and chip sampling.

samples are not presented or considered
to be representative of the average grade.
Grab samples only represent the grade at
a single point within the rock exposure.
Sample spacing is designed to allow an
initial assessment of gold mineralisation
and is not suitable for future resource
estimation activities.
All drill related data are referenced to the
original ASX report by date published. All
details appear in the original report.
Regional soil lines are aligned with near
east-west ridge lines and are
approximately perpendicular to the strike
of the interpreted regional shear systems
hosting disseminated sulphide and gold
where possible. A small number of lines
or portions of lines run at a lower angle to
the interpreted mineralisation trend, this is
shown graphically in the body of the
report.
No significant sample bias is considered to
be introduced because of the orientation of
the soil lines without being noted in the
body of the report.
Grab samples do not capture any aspect
of the potential variation in grade in
relation to the orientation of the
mineralisation and represents only a single
point inside the mineralisation. Chip
samples are collected perpendicular to
strike where possible to avoid any sample
bias and only where outcrop or subcrop
exists. The orientation of rock chip
samples is recorded and indicated in
diagrams.
All samples submitted for analysis are
placed in sealed plastic bags and
enclosed in strong plastic boxes, delivered
to a commercial transport company for
delivery to the laboratory. Any evidence of
sample damage or tampering is
immediately reported by the laboratory to
the company and a decision made as to
the integrity of the sample and the
remaining samples within the damaged /

The Sandy Creek and Tallandoon goldfields
have previously been explored to establish the
remaining alluvial potential and limited effort to
review reef style historic mines with surface
and underground mapping and sampling
carried out ( EL873, BHP Minerals Ltd, 19801982; EL1463, Tallangalook Ltd, 1984-1988;
EL3574, Exminco, 1993-1994; EL4039,
Northern Copper Ltd, 1996-1997; EL4812,
Goldsearch Ltd, 2004-2008; EL5241, Golden
Deeps Ltd, 2009-2011). All previous
exploration efforts have focused on narrowvein quartz potential, with very little focus on
alteration within the granite and minor
structural analysis. Dart Mining is the first
explorer to recognize the roof pendant style of
mineralisation and assess the structural
control on the distribution on mineralisation.
Tallangalook Ltd and Goldsearch Ltd
undertook some basic geological mapping of
the Sandy Creek area. Tallangalook Ltd dug &
sampled costeans across some workings.
Goldsearch Ltd drilled 3 short diamond drill
holes, but terminated all before hitting
mineralisation.
The Sandy Creek Goldfield was a traditional
narrow vein, high grade (free gold) reef style
field with a minor alluvial gold footprint. Dart
Mining recognized some gold mineralization is
related to disseminated sulphides in altered
granites along structurally-controlled
intersections within a metasedimentary roof
