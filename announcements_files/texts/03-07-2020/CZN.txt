IMPORTANT NOTES

For personal use only

This Prospectus is dated 3 July 2020 and was lodged with the ASIC on that date.
The ASIC, the ASX and their respective officers take no responsibility for the
contents of this Prospectus or the merits of the investment to which this Prospectus
relates.
No Securities may be issued on the basis of this Prospectus later than 13 months
after the date of this Prospectus.
No person is authorised to give information or to make any representation in
connection with this Prospectus, which is not contained in the Prospectus. Any
information or representation not so contained may not be relied on as having
been authorised by the Company in connection with this Prospectus.
It is important that investors read this Prospectus in its entirety and seek professional
advice where necessary. The Shares the subject of this Prospectus should be
considered highly speculative.
Applications for Securities offered pursuant to this Prospectus can only be
submitted on an original Entitlement and Acceptance Form or Shortfall
Application Form.
This Prospectus is a transaction specific prospectus for an offer of continuously
quoted securities (as defined in the Corporations Act) and has been prepared in
accordance with section 713 of the Corporations Act. It does not contain the
same level of disclosure as an initial public offering prospectus. In making
representations in this Prospectus regard has been had to the fact that the
Company is a disclosing entity for the purposes of the Corporations Act and
certain matters may reasonably be expected to be known to investors and
professional advisers whom potential investors may consult.
2.1

Forward-looking statements
This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements which are identified by words
such as ‘may’, ‘could’, ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘targets’, ‘expects’, or ‘intends’ and
other similar words that involve risks and uncertainties.
These statements are based on an assessment of present economic and
operating conditions, and on a number of assumptions regarding future events
and actions that, as at the date of this Prospectus, are expected to take place.
Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important
factors, many of which are beyond the control of our Company, the Directors and
our management.
We cannot and do not give any assurance that the results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained
in this prospectus will actually occur and investors are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
We have no intention to update or revise forward-looking statements, or to publish
prospective financial information in the future, regardless of whether new
information, future events or any other factors affect the information contained in
this prospectus, except where required by law.

2519-11/2443702_4

These forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or
anticipated in these statements. These risk factors are set out in Section 7 of this
Prospectus.

2.2

Electronic prospectus
If you have received this Prospectus as an electronic Prospectus, please ensure
that you have received the entire Prospectus accompanied by the Application
Forms. If you have not, please phone the Company on (08) 6364 0518 and the
Company will send you, for free, either a hard copy or a further electronic copy
of the Prospectus, or both. Alternatively, you may obtain a copy of this Prospectus
from the Company’s website at www.corazon.com.au.
The Company reserves the right not to accept an Application Form from a person
if it has reason to believe that when that person was given access to the electronic
Application Form, it was not provided together with the electronic Prospectus and
any relevant supplementary or replacement prospectus or any of those
documents were incomplete or altered.

2.3

Financial forecasts
The Directors have considered the matters set out in ASIC Regulatory Guide 170
and believe that they do not have a reasonable basis to forecast future earnings
on the basis that the operations of the Company are inherently uncertain.
Accordingly, any forecast or projection information would contain such a broad
range of potential outcomes and possibilities that it is not possible to prepare a
reliable best estimate forecast or projection.

2.4

Clearing House Electronic Sub-Register System (CHESS) and Issuer Sponsorship
The Company will not be issuing share or option certificates. The Company is a
participant in CHESS, for those investors who have, or wish to have, a sponsoring
stockbroker. Investors who do not wish to participate through CHESS will be issuer
sponsored by the Company. Because the sub-registers are electronic, ownership
of securities can be transferred without having to rely upon paper
documentation.
Electronic registers mean that the Company will not be issuing certificates to
investors. Instead, investors will be provided with a statement (similar to a bank
account statement) that sets out the number of Securities issued to them under
this Prospectus. The notice will also advise holders of their Holder Identification
Number or Security Holder Reference Number and explain, for future reference,
the sale and purchase procedures under CHESS and issuer sponsorship.
Further monthly statements will be provided to holders if there have been any
changes in their security holding in the Company during the preceding month.

2.5

Privacy Act
If you complete an application for Securities, you will be providing personal
information to the Company (directly or by the Company’s share registry). The
Company collects, holds and will use that information to assess your application,
service your needs as a holder of equity securities in the Company, facilitate
distribution payments and corporate communications to you as a Shareholder
and carry out administration.

For personal use only

The information may also be used from time to time and disclosed to persons
inspecting the register, bidders for your securities in the context of takeovers,
regulatory bodies, including the Australian Taxation Office, authorised securities
brokers, print service providers, mail houses and the Company’s share registry.
You can access, correct and update the personal information that we hold about
you. Please contact the Company or its share registry if you wish to do so at the
relevant contact numbers set out in this Prospectus.
Collection, maintenance and disclosure of certain personal information is
governed by legislation including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (as amended), the
Corporations Act and certain rules such as the ASX Settlement Operating Rules.
You should note that if you do not provide the information required on the
application for Securities, the Company may not be able to accept or process
your application.

Summary of the Placement and Entitlement Offer
As announced on 1 July 2020, the Company is intending to conduct a placement
and non-renounceable entitlement offer in order to raise up to approximately
$1.678 million (before costs).
Placement
The Company has received firm commitments from sophisticated and
professional investors to raise approximately $713,968 via the issue of up to
356,984,000 Shares at an issue price of $0.002 per Share. Participants will also be
issued one (1) attaching unlisted Option for every one (1) Share subscribed for
and issued (Placement Options), subject to Shareholder approval.
It is anticipated that the Placement Shares will be issued on Friday 10 July 2020
pursuant to the Company’s available placement capacity under ASX Listing Rule
7.1. The Company will seek Shareholder approval at a general meeting to be
held on or around August 2020, to issue the Placement Options to participants in
the Placement.
Further details in respect of the Placement are set out in the ASX announcement
released by the Company on 1 July 2020.

2519-11/2443702_4

Entitlement Offer

For personal use only

The Entitlement Offer is being made as a pro-rata non-renounceable entitlement
offer of one (1) Share for every five (5) Shares held by Eligible Shareholders
registered at the Record Date at an issue price of $0.002 per Share to raise up to
$963,958, together with one (1) free attaching unlisted Option for every one (1)
Share issued (exercisable at $0.0035 each on or before 30 June 2021).
Further details in respect of the Entitlement Offer are set out in Section 4.
3.3

Risk factors
Potential investors should be aware that subscribing for Securities in the Company
involves a number of risks. The key risk factors of which investors should be aware
are set out in Section 7 of this Prospectus. These risks, together with other general
risks applicable to all investments in securities not specifically referred to, may
affect the value of Securities in the future. Accordingly, an investment in the
Company should be considered highly speculative. Investors should consider
consulting their professional advisers before deciding whether to apply for
Securities pursuant to this Prospectus.
A summary of some of the Company’s key specific risks include:
Risk

Description

Potential for
significant
dilution

Upon implementation of the Entitlement Offer
and the Placement, assuming that 356,984,000
Shares are issued under the Placement, all
Entitlements are accepted, and no convertible
securities are exercised prior to the Record Date,
the number of Shares in the Company will
increase from 2,409,895,954 Shares currently on
issue to 3,248,859,145 Shares. In addition, the
Company will issue the Dunlop Shares, which will
result in the number of Shares on issue increasing
to 3,253,359,145 Shares. This means that each
Share will represent a significantly lower
proportion of the ownership of the Company.
Further, if the New Options are subsequently
exercised and Shares are issued on exercise of
those New Options, each Share will represent a
significantly lower proportion of the ownership of
the Company.

Reference in
Prospectus
Section
7.2(a)

It is not possible to predict what the value of the
Company or a Share will be following the
completion of the Entitlement Offer and the
Placement and the Directors do not make any
representation as to such matters.
The last trading price of Shares on ASX prior to
the Prospectus being lodged of $0.002 is not a
reliable indicator as to the potential trading
price of Shares after implementation of the
Entitlement Offer and the Placement.

Description

Going
Concern

The Company’s financial report for the half year
ended 31 December 2019 (released to ASX on
28 April 2020) includes a note on the financial
condition of the Company and the possible
existence of an inherent uncertainty about the
consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern.

Reference in
Prospectus
Section
7.2(b)

Notwithstanding
the
‘going
concern’
paragraph included in the financial report for
the half year ended 31 December 2019, the
Directors believe that the Company has
sufficient funds to adequately meet the
Company’s current expenditure commitments
and
short-term
working
capital
requirements. However, it is highly likely that
further funding will be required to meet the
medium to long term working capital costs of
the Company.
Additional
Requirements
for Capital

As set out above, the Company may require
further funding in the future to effectively
implement its business and operations plans, to
of
opportunities
for
take
advantage
acquisitions,
joint
ventures
or
other
opportunities, and to meet any unanticipated
liabilities or expenses which the Company may
incur. Any additional equity financing will dilute
shareholdings, and debt financing, if available,
may involve restrictions on financing and
operating activities. If the Company is unable
to obtain additional financing as needed, it may
be required to scale back its exploration
programmes, as the case may be. There is
however no guarantee that the Company will
be able to secure any additional funding or be
able to secure funding on terms favourable to
the Company.

Section
7.2(c)

Exploration
Risks

No assurance can be given that exploration will
be successful or that a commercial mining
operation will eventuate. The ultimate success
and financial viability of the Company depends
on the discovery and delineation of
economically recoverable ore reserves, design
and construction of efficient mining and
processing
facilities,
and
competent
operational and managerial performance.
There is no assurance that exploration and
development of the mineral interests held by the
Company (which are all at an exploration
stage), or any other projects that may be
acquired by the Company in the future, will
result in the discovery of an economic deposit.
Even if an apparently viable deposit is identified,

Section
7.2(d)

Risk

Description

Reference in
Prospectus

For personal use only

there is no guarantee that it can be profitably
exploited.
Development of a commercial mining
operation is also dependent on the Company's
ability to obtain necessary governmental and
other regulatory approvals.
Project and
Joint Venture
Risk

There is a risk of financial failure or default under
the joint venture arrangements by a participant
in any joint venture to which the Company is, or
may become, a party. Any withdrawal by a
joint venture party or any issues with their ability
to perform the obligations due under the joint
venture arrangements could have a material
adverse impact on the financial position of the
Company. There is also the risk of disputes
arising with the Company’s joint venture
partners, the resolution of which could lead to
delays
in
the
Company’s
proposed
development activities or financial loss.

Section
7.2(e)

COVID-19

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) is impacting global economic
markets. The nature and extent of the effect of
the outbreak on the performance of the
Company remains unknown. The Company’s
Share price may be adversely affected in the
short to medium term by the economic
uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Further, any
governmental or industry measures taken in
response to COVID-19 may adversely impact
the Company’s operations and are likely to be
beyond the control of the Company. The
Company confirms that it has not been
materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
to date.
The Directors are monitoring the situation closely
and have considered the impact of COVID-19
on the Company’s business and financial
performance.
However, the situation is
continually evolving, and the consequences
are therefore inevitably uncertain.
In
compliance with its continuous disclosure
obligations, the Company will continue to
update the market in regard to the impact of
COVID-19 on the Company. If any of these
impacts appear material prior to close of the
Entitlement Offer, the Company will notify
investors under a supplementary prospectus.

3.7

Effect on control of the Company and potential dilution to Shareholders

For personal use only

Based on the current Shareholding and Entitlements of Shareholders (including
substantial Shareholders) as at the date of this Prospectus, regardless of the
amount raised under the Entitlement Offer, no Shareholder will increase their
holding, to an amount in excess of 19.9% of all the Shares on issue through
applying for their Entitlements.
As set out in Section 4.7, on the basis of the allocation policy, no person will
acquire, through participation in the Shortfall Offer a holding of Shares of, or
increase their holding to, an amount in excess of 19.9% of all the Shares on issue
on completion of the Entitlement Offer.
Further, there will be no change to any Shareholder’s voting power as a result of
the issue of the New Options. Where New Options are exercised into Shares, the
voting power of the Shareholders who exercise the New Options will increase. The
likelihood of New Options being exercised is dependent on the price of Shares
from time to time until the New Options expire.
Shareholders should note that if they do not participate in the Entitlement Offer or
the Placement (assuming that 356,984,000 Shares are issued under the Placement,
4,500,000 Shares are issued to the Dunlop Vendors and the Entitlement Offer is fully
subscribed), their holdings are likely to be diluted by approximately 25.93% (as
compared to their holdings and number of Shares on issue as at the date of the
Prospectus) from the issue of Shares.
Examples of how the dilution may impact Shareholders are set out in the table
below:

Notes:
1.

This is based on a share capital of 2,409,895,954 Shares as at the date of the Prospectus
and assumes no Options or Performance Rights currently on issue or New Options
issued under the Prospectus are exercised.

2.

The dilutionary effect shown in the table is the maximum percentage on the
assumption that 356,984,000 Shares are issued under the Placement, 4,500,000 Shares
are issued to the Dunlop Vendors and those Entitlements not accepted are placed
under the Shortfall Offer. In the event all Entitlements are not accepted and some or
all of the resulting Shortfall was not subsequently placed, the dilution effect for each
Shareholder not accepting their Entitlement would be a lesser percentage.

No immediate dilution will occur as a result of the issue of New Options under this
Prospectus. However, the subsequent exercise of any or all the New Options will
result in dilution. Assuming all New Options offered pursuant to this Prospectus are
issued and exercised into Shares, Shareholders who do not participate in the
Entitlement Offer or the Placement (assuming that 356,984,000 Shares are issued
under the Placement, 4,500,000 Shares are issued to the Dunlop Vendors and the
Entitlement Offer is fully subscribed) are likely to be diluted by an aggregate of
2519-11/2443702_4

10

For personal use only

approximately 35.48% (as compared to their holdings and number of Shares on
issue as at the date of the Prospectus). If Shareholder approval is obtained for the
issue of the Placement Options, further dilution will occur as a result of the exercise
of the Placement Options.

4.5

Payment by BPAY®

For personal use only

For payment by BPAY®, please follow the instructions on the Entitlement and
Acceptance Form. You can only make a payment via BPAY® if you are the holder
of an account with an Australian financial institution that supports BPAY®
transactions. Please note that should you choose to pay by BPAY®:
(a)

you do not need to submit the Entitlement and Acceptance Form but are
taken to have made the declarations on that Entitlement and
Acceptance Form;

(b)

if you do not pay for your Entitlement in full, you are deemed to have
taken up your Entitlement in respect of such whole number of Securities
which is covered in full by your application monies; and

(c)

if you pay more than is required to subscribe for your Entitlement, you will
be taken to have applied for Shortfall Securities (if any) under the Shortfall
Offer, to the extent of the excess.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your BPAY® payment is received by the share
registry by no later than 5:00pm (WST) on the Closing Date. You should be aware
that your financial institution may implement earlier cut-off times with regards to
electronic payment and you should therefore take this into consideration when
making payment. Any application monies received for more than your final
allocation of Securities (only where the amount is $1.00 or greater) will be
refunded. No interest will be paid on any application monies received or
refunded.
One (1) New Option with an exercise price of $0.0035 and an expiry date of
30 June 2021 will be issued for every one (1) Share subscribed for and issued under
the Entitlement Offer.
4.6

Payment by cheque/bank draft
All cheques must be drawn on an Australian bank or bank draft made payable in
Australian currency to “Corazon Mining Limited” and crossed “Not Negotiable”.
Your completed Entitlement and Acceptance Form and cheque must reach the
Company’s share registry no later than 5:00 pm WST on the Closing Date.

4.7

Shortfall Offer
Any Entitlement not taken up pursuant to the Entitlement Offer will form the
Shortfall Offer.
The Shortfall Offer is a separate offer made pursuant to this Prospectus and will
remain open for up to three months following the Closing Date. The issue price
for each Share to be issued under the Shortfall Offer shall be $0.002 being the
price at which Shares have been offered under the Entitlement Offer.
If you do not wish to take up any part of your Entitlement you are not required to
take any action. That part of your Entitlement not taken up will form part of the
Shortfall Offer and potentially be allocated to other Eligible Shareholders or other
third parties as part of the Shortfall Offer. The Shortfall Offer will only be available
where there is a Shortfall between applications received from Eligible
Shareholders and the number of Securities proposed to be issued under the
Entitlement Offer.

2519-11/2443702_4

14

For personal use only

Eligible Shareholders who wish to subscribe for Securities above their Entitlement
are invited to apply for Shortfall Securities under the Shortfall Offer by completing
the appropriate section on their Entitlement and Acceptance Form or by making
payment for such Shortfall Securities in accordance with Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of
this Prospectus.
The Directors reserve the right to issue Shortfall Securities at their absolute
discretion. The Board presently intends to allocate Shortfall Securities as follows:
(a)

to Eligible Shareholders who apply for an excess of their full Entitlement,
so long as the issue of Shortfall Securities to that Eligible Shareholder would
not take their voting power to in excess of 19.99%; and

(b)

to other parties identified by the Directors, which may include parties not
currently Shareholders of the Company. No Shares will be issued to a
party under the Shortfall Offer if the effect would be to increase that
party’s voting power in the Company to an amount greater than 19.99%.

The Company reserves the right to issue an Eligible Shareholder a lesser number of
Shortfall Securities than applied for or no Shortfall Securities at all. However, the
Directors do not intend to refuse an application for Shortfall Securities from Eligible
Shareholders other than in circumstances of oversubscription or where
acceptance may result in a breach of the Corporations Act. If the number of
Shortfall Securities applied for by Eligible Shareholders exceeds the total Shortfall,
the Shortfall Securities will be allocated among applying Eligible Shareholders
proportionate to their existing holdings.
All decisions regarding the allocation of Shortfall Securities will be made by the
Directors and will be final and binding on all applicants under the Shortfall Offer;
as such there is no guarantee that any Shortfall Securities applied for will be issued
to Eligible Shareholders.
The Company will have no liability to any Applicant who receives less than the
number of additional Securities they applied for under the Shortfall Offer. If the
Company scales back any applications for Securities under the Shortfall Offer any
application monies will be returned (without interest) as soon as practicable.
4.8

Commissions payable
The Company reserves the right to pay a commission of up to 6% (exclusive of
goods and services tax) of amounts subscribed through any licensed securities
dealers or Australian financial services licensee in respect of any valid applications
lodged and accepted by the Company under the Shortfall Offer and bearing the
stamp of the licensed securities dealer or Australian financial services licensee.
Payments will be subject to the receipt of a proper tax invoice from the licensed
securities dealer or Australian financial services licensee.

4.9

ASX listing
Application for Official Quotation of the Shares offered pursuant to this Prospectus
will be made in accordance with the timetable set out at the commencement of
this Prospectus. If ASX does not grant Official Quotation of the Shares offered
pursuant to this Prospectus before the expiration of 3 months after the date of
issue of the Prospectus, (or such period as varied by the ASIC), the Company will
not issue any Shares and will repay all application monies for the Shares within the
time prescribed under the Corporations Act, without interest. The fact that ASX
may grant Official Quotation to the Shares is not to be taken in any way as an
indication of the merits of the Company or the Shares now offered for subscription.

2519-11/2443702_4

15

The Company will not apply for Official Quotation of the New Options offered
under this Prospectus as the New Options will not be quoted.

For personal use only

4.10

Issue of Securities
Securities issued pursuant to the Entitlement Offer will be issued in accordance
with the ASX Listing Rules and timetable set out at the commencement of this
Prospectus.
Securities issued pursuant to the Shortfall Offer will be issued on a progressive basis.
Where the number of Securities issued is less than the number applied for, or where
no issue is made, surplus application monies will be refunded without any interest
to the Applicant as soon as practicable after the closing date of the Shortfall
Offer.
Pending the issue of the Securities or payment of refunds pursuant to this
Prospectus, all application monies will be held by the Company in trust for the
Applicants in a separate bank account as required by the Corporations Act. The
Company, however, will be entitled to retain all interest that accrues on the bank
account and each Applicant waives the right to claim interest.
Holding statements for Securities issued under the Entitlement Offer and Shortfall
Securities issued under the Shortfall Offer will be mailed in accordance with the
ASX Listing Rules.

4.11

Overseas shareholders
This Entitlement Offer does not, and is not intended to, constitute an offer in any
place or jurisdiction in which, or to any person to whom, it would not be lawful to
make such an offer or to issue this Prospectus.
It is not practicable for the Company to comply with the securities laws of overseas
jurisdictions having regard to the number of overseas Shareholders, the number
and value of Securities these Shareholders would be offered and the cost of
complying with regulatory requirements in each relevant jurisdiction. Accordingly,
the Entitlement Offer is not being extended and Securities will not be issued to
Shareholders with a registered address which is outside Australia or New Zealand.
New Zealand
This offer to New Zealand investors is a regulated offer made under Australian and
New Zealand law. In Australia, this is Chapter 8 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Aust)
and regulations made under that Act. In New Zealand, this is subpart 6 of Part 9
of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and Part 9 of the Financial Markets
Conduct Regulations 2014.
This Entitlement Offer and the content of the offer document are principally
governed by Australian rather than New Zealand law. In the main, the
Corporations Act 2001 (Aust) and the regulations made under that Act set out
how the offer must be made.
There are differences in how financial products are regulated under Australian
law. For example, the disclosure of fees for managed investment schemes is
different under the Australian regime. The rights, remedies, and compensation
arrangements available to New Zealand investors in Australian financial products
may differ from the rights, remedies, and compensation arrangements for New
Zealand financial products.

2519-11/2443702_4

16

For personal use only

Both the Australian and New Zealand financial markets regulators have
enforcement responsibilities in relation to this offer. If you need to make a
complaint about this offer, please contact the Financial Markets Authority, New
Zealand (http://www.fma.govt.nz). The Australian and New Zealand regulators
will work together to settle your complaint.
The taxation treatment of Australian financial products is not the same as for New
Zealand financial products.
If you are uncertain about whether this investment is appropriate for you, you
should seek the advice of an appropriately qualified financial adviser.
The Entitlement Offer may involve a currency exchange risk. The currency for the
financial products is not New Zealand dollars. The value of the financial products
will go up or down according to changes in the exchange rate between that
currency and New Zealand dollars. These changes may be significant.
If you expect the financial products to pay any amounts in a currency that is not
New Zealand dollars, you may incur significant fees in having the funds credited
to a bank account in New Zealand in New Zealand dollars.
If the financial products are able to be traded on a financial product market and
you wish to trade the financial products through that market, you will have to
make arrangements for a participant in that market to sell the financial products
on your behalf. If the financial product market does not operate in New Zealand,
the way in which the market operates, the regulation of participants in that
market, and the information available to you about the financial products and
trading may differ from financial product markets that operate in New Zealand.
Nominees and custodians
Nominees and custodians may not submit an Entitlement and Acceptance Form
on behalf of any Shareholder resident outside Australia and New Zealand without
the prior consent of the Company, taking into account relevant securities law
restrictions. Return of a duly completed Entitlement and Acceptance Form will be
taken by the Company to constitute a representation that there has been no
breach of those regulations.
4.12

Enquiries
Any questions concerning the Entitlement Offer should be directed to Robert Orr,
Company Secretary, on (08) 6364 0518.

PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE ENTITLEMENT OFFER AND THE PLACEMENT

5.1

Purpose of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement

For personal use only

The purpose of the Entitlement Offer is to raise up to $963,958 (before expenses).
No funds will be raised from the issue of the New Options.
The purpose of the Placement is to raise up to approximately $713,968 (before
expenses). No funds will be raised from the issue of the Placement Options.
The funds raised from the Entitlement Offer and the Placement are planned to be

Notes:
1.

At Mt Gilmore in New South Wales, the Company’s exploration seeks to define drill targets
within the large copper-cobalt-silver-gold geochemical anomalies that have been
identified within the plus twenty-kilometre long project area. Current studies are focussed
on using detailed geochemical analysis of the mineralisation and alteration to vector in
on target areas.

2.

The Company’s exploration focus is on the Lynn Lake Project in Manitoba, Canada.
Proposed exploration at Lynn Lake includes the continued exploration for new nickelcopper sulphide deposits, utilizing geophysics, geochemistry and drilling; as well as the
continued advancement of resource, metallurgical and mining studies within the Lynn
Lake Mining Centre.

3.

Refer to Section 8.7 of this Prospectus for further details relating to the estimated expenses
of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement.

4.

As set out in Section 4.8 of this Prospectus, the Company may pay a commission of up to
6% (ex GST) of amounts subscribed through any licensed securities dealers or Australian
financial services licensee in respect of any valid applications lodged and accepted by
the Company under the Shortfall Offer. The calculation of the expenses of the
Entitlement Offer and the Placement as set out in the table above assumes that the
Entitlement Offer is fully subscribed and 356,984,000 Shares are issued under the
Placement. If the Entitlement Offer is not fully subscribed and the Shortfall is subsequently
placed, a commission of up to $57,388 will be payable, which will reduce the amount
allocated to working capital.

The above table is a statement of current intentions as of the date of this
Prospectus. As with any budget, intervening events (including exploration success
or failure) and new circumstances have the potential to affect the manner in
which the funds are ultimately applied. The Board reserves the right to alter the
way funds are applied on this basis. The Company retains a level of flexibility to
vary its future funding commitments. Funds raised from the Entitlement Offer and
the Placement will augment existing cash at bank.
The Directors believe that on completion of the Entitlement Offer and the
Placement, the Company will have sufficient working capital to carry out its stated
objectives. In the event the Entitlement Offer is not fully subscribed, operational
2519-11/2443702_4

18

objectives are likely to be modified, which may result in delay, or substantial
changes to the Company’s future plans. In this event (and after accounting for
associated Entitlement Offer costs) it is likely that the Company will appropriately
scale back funds available for exploration at the Lynn Lake Project (Item 2) and
the Mt Gilmore Project (Item 1) on a proportionate basis.

5.2

Effect of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement
The principal effect of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement, assuming all
Entitlements are accepted, 356,984,000 Shares are issued under the Placement
and no Options are exercised prior to the Record Date, will be to:

5.3

(a)

increase the cash reserves by $1,600,000 (after deducting the estimated
expenses of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement) immediately after
completion of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement;

(b)

increase the number of Shares on issue from 2,409,895,954 as at the date
of this Prospectus to 3,248,859,145 Shares following completion of the
Entitlement Offer and the Placement. In addition, the Company is
intending to issue 4,500,000 Vendor Shares which will result in the number
of Shares on issue increasing to 3,253,359,145 Shares; and

(c)

increase the number of Options on issue from 534,630,094 as at the date
of this Prospectus to 1,016,609,285 Options following completion of the
Entitlement Offer. If Shareholder approval is subsequently obtained for
the issue of Options to participants in the Placement, the number of
Options on issue will further increase to 1,373,593,285 Options.

RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ATTACHING TO SECURITIES

6.1

Shares
The following is a summary of the more significant rights and liabilities attaching to
Shares being offered pursuant to this Prospectus. This summary is not exhaustive
and does not constitute a definitive statement of the rights and liabilities of
Shareholders. To obtain such a statement, persons should seek independent legal
advice.
Full details of the rights and liabilities attaching to Shares are set out in the
Constitution, a copy of which is available for inspection at the Company’s
registered office during normal business hours.
(a)

General meetings
Shareholders are entitled to be present in person, or by proxy, attorney or
representative to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company.
Shareholders may requisition meetings in accordance with section 249D
of the Corporations Act and the Constitution of the Company.

(b)

Voting rights
Subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any
class or classes of shares, at general meetings of shareholders or classes
of shareholders:

(c)

(i)

each Shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by
proxy, attorney or representative;

(ii)

on a show of hands, every person present who is a Shareholder
or a proxy, attorney or representative of a Shareholder has one
vote; and

(iii)

on a poll, every person present who is a Shareholder or a proxy,
attorney or representative of a Shareholder shall, in respect of
each fully paid Share held by him, or in respect of which he is
appointed a proxy, attorney or representative, have one vote for
each Share held, but in respect of partly paid shares shall have
such number of votes as bears the same proportion to the total
of such Shares registered in the Shareholder’s name as the
amount paid (not credited) bears to the total amounts paid and
payable (excluding amounts credited).

Dividend rights
Subject to the rights of any preference Shareholders and to the rights of
the holders of any shares created or raised under any special
arrangement as to dividend, the Directors may from time to time declare
a dividend to be paid to the Shareholders entitled to the dividend which
shall be payable on all Shares according to the proportion that the
amount paid (not credited) is of the total amounts paid and payable
(excluding amounts credited) in respect of such Shares.

2519-11/2443702_4

22

For personal use only

The Directors may from time to time pay to the Shareholders any interim
dividends as they may determine. No dividend shall carry interest as
against the Company. The Directors may set aside out of the profits of
the Company any amounts that they may determine as reserves, to be
applied at the discretion of the Directors, for any purpose for which the
profits of the Company may be properly applied.
Subject to the ASX Listing Rules and the Corporations Act, the Company
may, by resolution of the Directors, implement a dividend reinvestment
plan on such terms and conditions as the Directors think fit and which
provides for any dividend which the Directors may declare from time to
time payable on Shares which are participating Shares in the dividend
reinvestment plan, less any amount which the Company shall either
pursuant to the Constitution or any law be entitled or obliged to retain,
be applied by the Company to the payment of the subscription price of
Shares.
(d)

Winding-up
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the authority of a
special resolution, divide among the Shareholders in kind the whole or
any part of the property of the Company, and may for that purpose set
such value as he considers fair upon any property to be so divided, and
may determine how the division is to be carried out as between the
Shareholders or different classes of Shareholders.
The liquidator may, with the authority of a special resolution, vest the
whole or any part of any such property in trustees upon such trusts for the
benefit of the contributories as the liquidator thinks fit, but so that no
Shareholder is compelled to accept any shares or other securities in
respect of which there is any liability.

(e)

Shareholder liability
As the Shares issued will be fully paid shares, they will not be subject to
any calls for money by the Directors and will therefore not become liable
for forfeiture.

(f)

Transfer of shares
Generally, shares in the Company are freely transferable, subject to
formal requirements, the registration of the transfer not resulting in a
contravention of or failure to observe the provisions of a law of Australia
and the transfer not being in breach of the Corporations Act and the ASX
Listing Rules.

(g)

Future increase in capital
The issue of any new Shares is under the control of the Directors of the
Company. Subject to restrictions on the issue or grant of Securities
contained in the ASX Listing Rules, the Constitution and the Corporations
Act (and without affecting any special right previously conferred on the
holder of an existing share or class of shares), the Directors may issue
Shares as they shall, in their absolute discretion, determine.

2519-11/2443702_4

23

(h)

Variation of rights

For personal use only

Under section 246B of the Corporations Act, the Company may, with the
sanction of a special resolution passed at a meeting of Shareholders vary
or abrogate the rights attaching to shares.
If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares,
the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms
of issue of the shares of that class), whether or not the Company is being
wound up, may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the
holders of three quarters of the issued shares of that class, or if authorised
by a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of
the shares of that class.
(i)

RISK FACTORS

7.1

Introduction
The Securities offered under this Prospectus are considered highly speculative. An
investment in the Company is not risk free and the Directors strongly recommend
potential investors to consider the risk factors described below, together with
information contained elsewhere in this Prospectus and to consult their
professional advisers before deciding whether to apply for Securities pursuant to
this Prospectus.
There are specific risks which relate directly to the Company’s business. In
addition, there are other general risks, many of which are largely beyond the
control of the Company and the Directors. The risks identified in this section, or
other risk factors, may have a material impact on the financial performance of
the Company and the market price of the Securities.
The following is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the risk factors to which the
Company is exposed.

7.2

Company specific
(a)

Potential for significant dilution
Upon implementation of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement,
assuming that 356,984,000 Shares are issued under the Placement, all
Entitlements are accepted, and no convertible securities are exercised
prior to the Record Date, the number of Shares in the Company will
increase from 2,409,895,954 Shares currently on issue up to 3,248,859,145
Shares. In addition, the Company will issue the Dunlop Shares, which will
result in the number of Shares on issue increasing up to 3,253,359,145
Shares. This means that each Share will represent a significantly lower
proportion of the ownership of the Company.
Further if the New Options are subsequently exercised and Shares are
issued on exercise of those New Options, each Share will represent a
significantly lower proportion of the ownership of the Company.
It is not possible to predict what the value of the Company or a Share will
be following the completion of the Entitlement Offer and the Placement
and the Directors do not make any representation as to such matters.
The last trading price of Shares on ASX prior to the Prospectus being
lodged of $0.002 is not a reliable indicator as to the potential trading price
of Shares after implementation of the Entitlement Offer and Placement.

(b)

Going concern
The Company’s financial report for the half year ended 31 December
2019 (released to ASX on 28 April 2020) includes a note on the financial
condition of the Company and the possible existence of an inherent
uncertainty about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern.
Notwithstanding the ‘going concern’ paragraph included in the financial
report for the half year ended 31 December 2019, the Directors believe
that the Company has sufficient funds to adequately meet the
Company’s current expenditure commitments and short-term working

2519-11/2443702_4

27

capital requirements. However, it is highly likely that further funding will
be required to meet the medium to long term working capital costs of the
Company. Please refer to Section 7.2(c) below for further details.

For personal use only

(c)

Additional Requirements for Capital
As set out above, the Company may require further funding in the future
to effectively implement its business and operations plans, to take
advantage of opportunities for acquisitions, joint ventures or other
opportunities, and to meet any unanticipated liabilities or expenses which
the Company may incur. Any additional equity financing will dilute
shareholdings, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictions
on financing and operating activities. If the Company is unable to obtain
additional financing as needed, it may be required to scale back its
exploration programmes, as the case may be. There is however no
guarantee that the Company will be able to secure any additional
funding or be able to secure funding on terms favourable to the
Company.

(d)

Exploration Risks
No assurance can be given that exploration will be successful or that a
commercial mining operation will eventuate. The ultimate success and
financial viability of the Company depends on the discovery and
delineation of economically recoverable ore reserves, design and
construction of efficient mining and processing facilities, and competent
operational and managerial performance.
There is no assurance that exploration and development of the mineral
interests held by the Company (which are all at an exploration stage), or
any other projects that may be acquired by the Company in the future,
will result in the discovery of an economic deposit. Even if an apparently
viable deposit is identified, there is no guarantee that it can be profitably
exploited.
Development of a commercial mining operation is also dependent on
the Company's ability to obtain necessary governmental and other
regulatory approvals.

(e)

Project and Joint Venture Risk
There is a risk of financial failure or default under the joint venture
arrangements by a participant in any joint venture to which the
Company is, or may become, a party. Any withdrawal by a joint venture
party or any issues with their ability to perform the obligations due under
the joint venture arrangements could have a material adverse impact on
the financial position of the Company. There is also the risk of disputes
arising with the Company’s joint venture partners, the resolution of which
could lead to delays in the Company’s proposed development activities
or financial loss. A summary of the Company’s current joint venture
agreements is set out below.
Mount Gilmore Project
The Company has an 80% equity ownership of exploration licence 8379,
which forms part of the Mt Gilmore Project (Tenement). Details of the
Mt Gilmore Project are set out in the ASX announcement released on
16 June 2016.

2519-11/2443702_4

28

For personal use only

The Company is a registered joint owner and manager of the Tenement
with the New South Wales Government Department of Planning and
Environment and therefore the Company is responsible for compliance
with the terms and conditions of the Tenement and any other applicable
legislation. Any failure to comply with these obligations may result in the
Company losing its interest in the Tenement, which may have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations and the performance and
value of the Securities. The Company has no current reason to believe it
will not meet and satisfy its respective obligations under the relevant
agreement, the Tenement conditions and other applicable legislation.
Lynn Lake – Victory Project
On 1 April 2015, the acquisition of the Victory Project from Victory Nickel
Inc. (the Vendor) was finalised. Details of the agreement to acquire the
Victory Project are set out in the ASX announcement released on 1 April
2015.
The terms of the acquisition include a requirement to spend an
aggregate amount of AUD$3.5 million on exploration and resource
development in a five-year period (concluding on 19 December 2019).
In November 2019 the Company notified the Vendor that this expenditure
commitment had been met.
The Company has notified the Vendor that it considers it has satisfied the
expenditure requirement. If a dispute arises as to the satisfaction of the
expenditure requirement, the Company may be required to pay the
Vendor the difference between AUD$3.5 million expenditure requirement
and was actually spent (in cash or Shares) or return the Victory Project to
Vendor.
(f)

Estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves
Mineral resource and reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and
involve subjective judgements regarding the presence and grade of
mineralisation and the ability to economically extract and process the
mineralisation, including future copper, cobalt, gold, silver and nickel
prices, operating costs, transport costs, capital expenditures and other
costs.
Fluctuations in the price of minerals, results of additional drilling,
metallurgical testing and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the
date of any mineral resource or reserve estimate may require revision of
such estimate. Any material reductions in estimates of mineral resources
or reserves, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position.
Investors should not assume that resource estimates are capable of being
directly reclassified as reserves under the JORC code. The inclusion of
resource estimates should not be regarded as representation that these
amounts can be economically exploited, and investors are cautioned
not to place reliance on resource estimates.

For personal use only

(g)

Native Title
It is possible that tenements in which the Company will acquire an interest
in may be subject to a native title claim. If native title rights do exist, the
ability of the Company to gain access to tenements (through obtaining
consent of any relevant landowner), or to progress from the exploration
phase to the development and mining phases of operations may be
adversely affected.

(h)

Exploration Success
The Company’s tenements are at various stages of exploration, and
potential investors should understand that mineral exploration and
development are high-risk undertakings.
There can be no assurance that exploration of the Company’s
tenements, or any other licenses that may be acquired in the future, will
result in the discovery of an economic ore deposit. Even if an apparently
viable deposit is identified, there is no guarantee that it can be
economically exploited.

(i)

Tenement applications and license renewal
The Company cannot guarantee additional applications for tenements
made by the Company will ultimately be granted, in whole or in part.
Further the Company cannot guarantee that renewals of valid
tenements will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.

7.3

Industry specific
(a)

Environmental
The operations and proposed activities of the Company are subject to
State and Federal laws and regulations concerning the environment. As
with most exploration projects and mining operations, the Company’s
activities are expected to have an impact on the environment,
particularly if advanced exploration or mine development proceeds. It is
the Company’s intention to conduct its activities to the highest standard
of environmental obligation, including compliance with all environmental
laws.
Mining operations have inherent risks and liabilities associated with safety
and damage to the environment and the disposal of waste products
occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. The
occurrence of any such safety or environmental incident could delay
production or increase production costs. Events, such as unpredictable
rainfall or bushfires may impact on the Company’s ongoing compliance
with environmental legislation, regulations and licences. Significant
liabilities could be imposed on the Company for damages, clean-up
costs or penalties in the event of certain discharges into the environment,
environmental damage caused by previous operations or noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations.
The disposal of mining and process waste and mine water discharge are
under constant legislative scrutiny and regulation. There is a risk that
environmental laws and regulations become more onerous making the
Company’s operations more expensive.

2519-11/2443702_4

30

Approvals are required for land clearing and for ground disturbing
activities. Delays in obtaining such approvals can result in the delay to
anticipated exploration programmes or mining activities.

For personal use only

(b)

Mine development
Possible future development of a mining operation at any of the
Company’s projects is dependent on a number of factors including, but
not limited to, the acquisition and/or delineation of economically
recoverable mineralisation, favourable geological conditions, receiving
the necessary approvals from all relevant authorities and parties,
seasonal weather patterns, unanticipated technical and operational
difficulties encountered in extraction and production activities,
mechanical failure of operating plant and equipment, shortages or
increases in the price of consumables, spare parts and plant and
equipment, cost overruns, access to the required level of funding and
contracting risk from third parties providing essential services.
If the Company commences production, its operations may be disrupted
by a variety of risks and hazards which are beyond its control, including
environmental hazards, industrial accidents, technical failures, labour
disputes, unusual or unexpected rock formations, flooding and extended
interruptions due to inclement of hazardous weather conditions and fires,
explosions or accidents. No assurance can be given that the Company
will achieve commercial viability through the development or mining of
its projects and treatment of ore.

(c)

Native Title and Aboriginal Heritage
In relation to tenements which the Company has an interest in or will in
the future acquire such an interest, there may be areas over which
legitimate common law native title rights of Aboriginal Australians exist. If
native title rights do exist, the ability of the Company to gain access to
tenements (through obtaining consent of any relevant landowner), or to
progress from the exploration phase to the development and mining
phases of operations may be adversely affected.

(d)

Operations
The operations of the Company may be affected by various factors,
including failure to locate or identify mineral deposits, failure to achieve
predicted grades in exploration and mining, operational and technical
difficulties encountered in mining, difficulties in commissioning and
operating plant and equipment, mechanical failure or plant breakdown,
unanticipated metallurgical problems which may affect extraction costs,
adverse weather conditions, industrial and environmental accidents,
industrial disputes and unexpected shortages or increases in the costs of
consumables, spare parts, plant and equipment.
No assurances can be given that the Company will achieve commercial
viability through the successful exploration and/or mining of its tenement
interests. Until the Company is able to realise value from its projects, it is
likely to incur ongoing operating losses.

2519-11/2443702_4

31

(e)

Climate Change

For personal use only

There are a number of climate-related factors that may affect the
operations and proposed activities of the Company. The climate
change risks particularly attributable to the Company include:

7.4

(i)

the emergence of new or expanded regulations associated with
the transitioning to a lower-carbon economy and market
changes related to climate change mitigation. The Company
may be impacted by changes to local or international
compliance regulations related to climate change mitigation
efforts, or by specific taxation or penalties for carbon emissions or
environmental damage. These examples sit amongst an array of
possible restraints on industry that may further impact the
Company and its profitability.
While the Company will
endeavour to manage these risks and limit any consequential
impacts, there can be no guarantee that the Company will not
be impacted by these occurrences; and

(ii)

climate change may cause certain physical and environmental
risks that cannot be predicted by the Company, including events
such as increased severity of weather patterns and incidence of
extreme weather events and longer-term physical risks such as
shifting climate patterns. All these risks associated with climate
change may significantly change the industry in which the
Company operates.

General risks
(a)

COVID-19
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting global
economic markets. The nature and extent of the effect of the outbreak
on the performance of the Company remains unknown. The Company’s
Share price may be adversely affected in the short to medium term by
the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19.
Further, any
governmental or industry measures taken in response to COVID-19 may
adversely impact the Company’s operations and are likely to be beyond
the control of the Company. The Company confirms that it has not been
materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.
The Directors are monitoring the situation closely and have considered
the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business and financial
performance. However, the situation is continually evolving, and the
consequences are therefore inevitably uncertain. In compliance with its
continuous disclosure obligations, the Company will continue to update
the market in regard to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company. If any
of these impacts appear material prior to close of the Entitlement Offer,
the Company will notify investors under a supplementary prospectus.

(b)

Economic
General economic conditions, movements in interest and inflation rates
and currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the
Company’s exploration, development and production activities, as well
as on its ability to fund those activities.

2519-11/2443702_4

32

(c)

Market conditions

For personal use only

Share market conditions may affect the value of the Company’s quoted
securities regardless of the Company’s operating performance. Share
market conditions are affected by many factors such as:
(i)

general economic outlook;

(ii)

introduction of tax reform or other new legislation;

(iii)

interest rates and inflation rates;

(iv)

changes in investor sentiment toward particular market sectors;

(v)

the demand for, and supply of, capital; and

(vi)

terrorism or other hostilities.

The market price of securities can fall as well as rise and may be subject
to varied and unpredictable influences on the market for equities in
general and resource exploration stocks in particular. Neither the
Company nor the Directors warrant the future performance of the
Company or any return on an investment in the Company.
(d)

Dividends
Any future determination as to the payment of dividends by the
Company will be at the discretion of the Directors and will depend on the
financial condition of the Company, future capital requirements and
general business and other factors considered relevant by the Directors.
No assurance in relation to the payment of dividends or franking credits
attaching to dividends can be given by the Company.

(e)

Taxation
The acquisition and disposal of Securities will have tax consequences,
which will differ depending on the individual financial affairs of each
investor. All potential investors in the Company are urged to obtain
independent financial advice about the consequences of acquiring
Securities from a taxation viewpoint and generally.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company, its officers and
each of their respective advisors accept no liability and responsibility with
respect to the taxation consequences of subscribing for Securities under
this Prospectus.

(f)

Reliance on key personnel
The responsibility of overseeing the day-to-day operations and the
strategic management of the Company depends substantially on its
senior management and its key personnel. There can be no assurance
given that there will be no detrimental impact on the Company if one or
more of these employees cease their employment.

7.5

Speculative investment

For personal use only

The above list of risk factors ought not to be taken as exhaustive of the risks faced
by the Company or by investors in the Company. The above factors, and others
not specifically referred to above, may in the future materially affect the financial
performance of the Company and the value of the Securities offered under this
Prospectus.
Therefore, the Securities to be issued pursuant to this Prospectus carry no
guarantee with respect to the payment of dividends, returns of capital or the
market value of those Securities.
Potential investors should consider that the investment in the Company is
speculative and should consult their professional advisers before deciding
whether to apply for Securities pursuant to this Prospectus.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

8.1

Litigation
As at the date of this Prospectus, the Company is not involved in any legal
proceedings and the Directors are not aware of any legal proceedings pending
or threatened against the Company.

8.2

Continuous disclosure obligations
The Company is a “disclosing entity” (as defined in section 111AC of the
Corporations Act) for the purposes of section 713 of the Corporations Act and, as
such, is subject to regular reporting and disclosure obligations. Specifically, like all
listed companies, the Company is required to continuously disclose any
information it has to the market which a reasonable person would expect to have
a material effect on the price or the value of the Company’s securities.
This Prospectus is a “transaction specific prospectus”. In general terms a
“transaction specific prospectus” is only required to contain information in relation
to the effect of the issue of securities on a company and the rights attaching to
the securities. It is not necessary to include general information in relation to all of
the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses or prospects of the
issuing company.
This Prospectus is intended to be read in conjunction with the publicly available
information in relation to the Company which has been notified to ASX and does
not include all of the information that would be included in a prospectus for an
initial public offering of securities in an entity that is not already listed on a stock
exchange. Investors should therefore have regard to the other publicly available
information in relation to the Company before making a decision whether or not
to invest.
Having taken such precautions and having made such enquires as are
reasonable, the Company believes that it has complied with the general and
specific requirements of ASX as applicable from time to time throughout the 3
months before the issue of this Prospectus which required the Company to notify
ASX of information about specified events or matters as they arise for the purpose
of ASX making that information available to the stock market conducted by ASX.
Information that is already in the public domain has not been reported in this
Prospectus other than that which is considered necessary to make this Prospectus
complete.
The Company, as a disclosing entity under the Corporations Act states that:
(a)

it is subject to regular reporting and disclosure obligations;

(b)

copies of documents lodged with the ASIC in relation to the Company
(not being documents referred to in section 1274(2)(a) of the
Corporations Act) may be obtained from, or inspected at, the offices of
the ASIC; and

(c)

it will provide a copy of each of the following documents, free of charge,
to any person on request between the date of issue of this Prospectus
and the Closing Date:
(i)

2519-11/2443702_4

the annual financial report most recently lodged by the
Company with the ASIC;
35

For personal use only

(ii)

any half-year financial report lodged by the Company with the
ASIC after the lodgement of the annual financial report referred
to in (i) and before the lodgement of this Prospectus with the
ASIC; and

(iii)

any continuous disclosure documents given by the Company to
ASX in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules as referred to in
section 674(1) of the Corporations Act after the lodgement of the
annual financial report referred to in (i) and before the
lodgement of this Prospectus with the ASIC.

Copies of all documents lodged with the ASIC in relation to the Company can be
inspected at the registered office of the Company during normal office hours.
Details of documents lodged by the Company with ASX since the date of
lodgement of the Company’s latest annual financial report and before the
lodgement of this Prospectus with the ASIC are set out in the table below.

Security holdings
The relevant interest of each of the Directors in the Securities of the Company as
at the date of this Prospectus, together with their respective Entitlement, is set in
Section 3.4 of this Prospectus.
Remuneration
The remuneration of an executive Director is decided by the Board, without the
affected executive Director participating in that decision-making process. The
total maximum remuneration of non-executive Directors is initially set by the
Constitution and subsequent variation is by ordinary resolution of Shareholders in
general meeting in accordance with the Constitution, the Corporations Act and
the ASX Listing Rules, as applicable. The determination of non-executive Directors’

remuneration within that maximum will be made by the Board having regard to
the inputs and value to the Company of the respective contributions by each
non-executive Director. The current amount has been set at an amount not to
exceed $400 000 per annum.
A Director may be paid fees or other amounts (i.e. non-cash performance
incentives such as Options, subject to any necessary Shareholder approval) as the
other Directors determine where a Director performs special duties or otherwise
performs services outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a Director. In
addition, Directors are also entitled to be paid reasonable travelling, hotel and
other expenses incurred by them respectively in or about the performance of their
duties as Directors.
The following table shows the total (and proposed) annual remuneration paid to
both executive and non-executive directors.
