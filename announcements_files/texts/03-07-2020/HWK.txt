950% INCREASE IN LANDHOLDING AT
WESTERN DESERT GOLD-COPPER PROJECT

HIGHLIGHTS
•

Following exciting results from recent exploration, Hawkstone has increased its
landholding by 950%, at the Western Desert Gold-Copper Project, located in Western
Utah, USA.

•

Rock chip sampling of outcropping mineralisation and old workings over the Project area
has returned high grade results of:
•

Gold (Au) to 6.92 g/t

•

Copper (Cu) to 5.09%

•

Silver (Ag) to 1,495 g/t

•

Lead (Pb) to >20%

•

These claims have been acquired at minimal cost and are the result of our teams
geological targeting and ground follow-up.

•

The Project lies within a similar geological setting to “Carlin type” mineralisation of the
prolific Carlin Gold Belt (Nevada, USA), with production of 200 million ounces of gold,
and 50 km east of the Newmont owned, Long Canyon Mine with resources of 4.5 million
ounces of gold 1.

•

Photogeological mapping identified 11 targets within the Project, with Targets A1 and A3
exhibiting features similar to Carlin type gold mineralisation, and are considered high
priority for exploration by the Company.

•

Stream sediment sampling has identified anomalous gold and Carlin type pathfinder
elements forming 4 broad zones coincident with the mapped targets.

•

These targets will now be the focus of further exploration, including the use of
geophysical methods to define the source of the anomalism and enable the definition of
drill targets.

Hawkstone Mining Limited (ASX:HWK) (“Hawkstone”, the “Company”) is pleased to provide an
update on exploration completed on the Western Desert Gold-Copper Project since the Company
acquired the Project on 16 March 2020. Based on exciting results from recent exploration, the
Company has increased its landholding in the area by 950%, expanding the total tenement package to
25.41km2, at the Western Desert Gold-Copper Project, located in Western Utah, USA.

Hawkstone Managing Director, Paul Lloyd, commented: “The Western Desert Gold-Copper
Project is living up to initial expectations by demonstrating its significant potential to host “Carlin type”
gold mineralisation. From the initial targeting and acquisition of the Project, the work to date has
defined exciting targets that we will progress in a logical and timely manner. With the known
mineralisation and ideal structural setting, Target A1 is high priority target for Hawkstone, and we see
the Project as holding excellent potential in an under explored geological terrain, that hosts some of
the world’s largest gold deposits.”

WESTERN DESERT GOLD-COPPER PROJECT
As announced on 16 March 2020, Hawkstone acquired the Western Desert Gold-Copper Project in
Western Utah, USA. Upon acquisition, the Project initially consisted of 30 lode mining claims covering
243 ha, however, following photogeological interpretation and the positive geochemical sampling and
assay results, the Company has staked a further 218 lode claims covering 1,764 ha and applied for 3
state leases, adding an additional 77 ha for a total tenement package of 25.41km2.
The Project offers significant upside through the application of modern exploration methods, and the
Company’s aims to advance the Project in the near term.
The Project is located in western Utah near to the Nevada Border. The closest town is Wendover, 42km
South West of the project, with the town straddling the Utah-Nevada Border, with good access to all
services and amenities (Figure 1). The Project is also readily accessible via maintained gravel roads
from Wendover.

Regional Geology

The Western Desert project is located within the
Basin & Range Province of the Western USA,
comprising a series of northerly striking, fault
bounded ranges. The project lies within the
same
sequence
of
Cambro-Ordovician
carbonate and sedimentary rocks, that host the
Carlin Trend gold deposits 200km to the west,
the Long Canyon gold mine (Newmont 4.5M oz
Au) 2 50 km to the west, and Tug Deposit
(431,000 oz Au and 13.8M oz Ag) of West
Kirkland Mining INC 3 40km to the north (Figure
1). The project also lies 150 km west-north-west
of the Bingham Canyon Mine (Rio Tinto 23Mt
Cu & 38.5M oz Au) 4.

Photogeological and Structural Interpretation

Hawkstone engaged independent consultant, Dr R Russell, to complete a photogeological – structural
interpretation and targeting on the Western Desert Project area. The Project lies on Crater Island, an
outcrop of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sediments and carbonates, intruded by later Mesozoic igneous
intrusives forming a peninsula in the great Salt Lake area of Utah. The stratigraphy and structure of the
outcrop is similar to the host rocks of the Carlin type gold.

A wedge of Carboniferous sediments and carbonate units in the west is thrust over pre-Carboniferous
units to the east within the Project. The northern and southern margins of the thrust sheet are marked
by NW-trending left lateral faulting in the north and NE-trending right lateral faulting in the south. The
main faults trend approximately north-south and are considered to be shallow-dipping thrust and
reverse faults, which may sole-out in the basin sediments. However, other north-south trends
particularly in the passive older block to the east, are thought to be older deep-seated fault trends,
which represent elements of the original basin-margin faults and pre-date the compressional structural
features of the basin. As such, they are likely to be important conduits for the rising mineralised fluids
emplaced during the 'late' extensional phase of the basin development (Figure 2).

Figure 2 – Photogeological Interpretation and Targeting (NAD 83 Zone 12)

Target A1

Target A1 covers an anticline in the south of the mapped area where Carboniferous carbonates and
clastic sediments are flexed against the Jurassic monzonite intrusions to the south. The fold axis trends
west-southwest and extends in this direction from the old Copper Blossom deposit that was the subject
of previous mapping and sampling (see ASX announcement 16 March 2020). A Late-Jurassic
monzodiorite plug intrudes into the crest of the anticline to the west.
The 'Copper Blossom' anticline, Target A1 appears to be a highly prospective exploration target
containing favourable elements for potential large-scale mineralisation (Figure 3):
•

The fold hinge represents a trap site for rising mineralised fluids.

•

Hot fluids from the monzodiorite intrusion could have introduced mineralisation.

•

The NE cross faulting could act as a conduit for later mineralised fluids.

•

•

The conglomerates of the Strathearn unconformity stratigraphically underlie the ‘Copper
Blossom’ mineralisation and could potentially provide a porous receptive host for ‘blind
mineralisation’.
This ‘blind mineralisation’ would not have been identified by previous prospectors.

Figure 3 – Target A1 Idealised Section A-A’, Stratigraphy and Carlin Genetic Model 5

Targets A2 to A5
The dominant structural grain across the Project is north-south resulting from compressive faults (thrust
and reverse). In part, these faults are marked by light or dark-toned zones which may represent
alteration. Other parts of the fault trends demonstrate shearing in the surrounding units. The identified
Targets A2 to A5 lie within these north-south trends in the younger post-Carboniferous overthrust
section. The targets are interpreted as the most prominent zones of possible alteration along the fault
systems. However, the entire strike of the main fault trends could also be viewed as prospective.

Target A6
An area of dark and light-toned superficial soils is mapped at Target A6 in the broad southern area of
alluvial outwash. The target is almost directly on-trend with the main N-S faults in the outcrop area to
the north, and potentially represents a buried mineralised zone at depth, where the N-S faults are
intersected by a NE-trending fault or fold axes.

Targets A7 to A8
A series of north-south trending faults occur in the pre-Carboniferous outcrops in the eastern part of
the mapped area. The orientation of these faults has greater variance than in the younger overthrust
sheet to the west, suggesting they have a different, possibly earlier, origin during the formation of the
Upper Proterozoic Rift on the western margin of 'Laurentia'. It is these 'shelf' to 'basin' breaks that
appear to be the key control to mineralisation in several mines in the Carlin area to the west (re: Rodeo

and Betze Post deposits) 6. Narrow iron-rich ridges possibly associated with deep seated faults are
mapped at Targets A7 and A8.

Targets A9 to A11

A major structural zone trending northwest-southeast in the northern part of the Project area, is
interpreted as a left lateral strike slip trend that partially terminates and offsets the stratigraphy in the
north of the island. Target A11 is located in an area of colluvial and alluvial cover. The dark-toned
soils here are thought to be iron-rich and may be related to proximal, underlying mineralisation.

Stream Sediment, Soil Geochemistry and Rock Chip Sampling

In May 2020, the Company completed a regional sampling programme consisting of 142 stream
sediment samples over the whole of the project area, 34 soil samples covering Targets A6 and A11,
and 20 rock chip samples from both Copper Blossom workings and other observed areas of alteration,
copper staining and previous workings.

Stream Sediment Sampling

The stream sediment program was designed to cover the entire Project area, covering all of the targets
identified by the photogeological interpretation. The samples from this program were analysed by ALS
Vancouver by method AuME-TL43, which provides low level detection for Au and a suite of 50 other
elements, including those considered path finders in ‘Carlin type’ mineralisation.

This stream sediment sampling has produced numerous geochemically anomalous areas for several
elements including Au and recognised path finder elements for Carlin style mineralisation, primarily
grouped in 4 main clusters, SS1 to SS4 (Figure 4). These clusters are closely related to the targets
identified by the photogeological mapping.

SS1 – Includes the Copper Blossom mineralisation and the Target A1. Anomalous Au (ppb) results
are present in drainages to the east and west of the Copper Blossom mineralised trend and to the north
of Target A1.
SS2 – Surrounds the central north south structural zone corresponding with the base of the western
overthrust carbonate unit over a strike length of 4km. Mapped Targets A5 and A6 lie within this
geochemically anomalous trend defined by elevated values for Au (ppb), Ag, As, Hg and Sb (ppm).

SS3 – Centred on one sample containing elevated values for both Au (ppb) and Ag (ppm)
corresponding to structural Target A10.

SS4 – Follows the NW trending, northern bounding structure corresponding to Targets A9 and A10,
and contains elevated values for Au (ppb), W (tungsten) and Mo (molybdenum) (ppm).

Soil Sampling

A total of 34 soil samples were completed on 100m E-W x 200m N-S grids across Targets A6 and
A11 (Figures 2 & 4).

The southern soils grid, Target A6, corresponds to dark and light toned soils and is on trend with the
N-S faults associated with Targets A2 and A3. Results from the sampling have returned elevated Ag,
3 samples returning >100ppb up to a maximum of 220ppb.

The northern soils grid, Target A11, corresponds to a similar staining in the soils on trend with Targets
A9 and A10. Results demonstrate the presence of elevated W, 3 samples >1ppm up to 1.91ppm and
Ag returned one sample containing 100ppb. The W is elevated in the stream sediment samples
corresponding to Targets A19 and A10 to the north west along strike.

These results demonstrate the potential continuation of the anomalous mineralised trends identified in
stream sediment sampling.

•

6 are anomalous for Au >0.2 g/t up to a maximum of 6.92 g/t Au.

•

16 samples contained Ag > 3g/t up to a maximum of 1,495 g/t Ag (48 oz).

•

Cu exceeded 100ppm in 19 samples up to 5.9%.

•

Pb exceeded 100ppm in 10 samples up to >20%.

•

Zn was >100 ppm in 10 samples up to 862 ppm, 2 samples contained Mo >200 ppm, Sb
returned 4 samples ranging from 111 to 231 ppm, Te returned 6 samples greater than 10 ppm
up to 381 ppm and W had 2 samples of 960 and 1,130 ppm from (Figure 5, Table 2).

These rock chip samples were taken in conjunction with the stream sediment and soil sampling prior
to any assay results being received. The samples were chosen on the basis of visible mineralisation
and/or the presence of historic workings. It should be noted that there were no samples taken within
the stream sediment SS1 cluster of anomalies. The rock chip sampling clearly demonstrates the
widespread nature of the mineralisation and the overall prospectivity of the Project, showing
geochemical associations similar to that identified in the stream sediment sampling results.

Planned Exploration

The next phase in the exploration process will consist of follow-up stream sediment sampling of tertiary
drainages within the anomalous zones to pinpoint the source of the anomalism. These programs will
be done in conjunction with geological mapping, soil and rock chip sampling.

The use of ground based geophysical methods is also being investigated to aid in defining drill targets.

Priority targets for this exploration are A1 and A3.

Sampling
techniques

Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels,
random chips, or specific specialised industry
standard measurement tools appropriate to the
minerals under investigation, such as down hole
gamma sondes, or handheld XRF
instruments, etc.). These examples should not be
taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.

This announcement primarily relates to results of 3
sampling programmes, stream sediment
geochemistry, soil sampling and rock chip grab
samples.

Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate
calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.

Rock grab samples were randomly taken over an
area of 1m2 while chip channel samples were taken
across the vein zone. Stream samples were taken at
drainage trap sites and the samples sieved at site to 200micron. Soil samples were taken at a depth of
20cm and sieved to -200micron on site.

Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that
are Material to the Public Report. In cases where
‘industry standard’ work has been done this would
be relatively simple (e.g. ‘reverse circulation drilling
was used to obtain 1m samples from which 3 kg was
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’).
In other cases, more explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent
sampling problems. Unusual commodities or
mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may
warrant disclosure of detailed information.

The samples are considered indicative of the
presence of mineralisation. Rock chip samples of 23kg in weight were dispatched to ALS Laboratories
where a 25gm charge was analysed by method MeMS41 and Au-AA25 that includes Au by fire assay.
Stream sediments and soil samples were collected

with third parties such as joint ventures,
partnerships, overriding royalties, native title
interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park
and environmental settings.

The Western Desert Gold-Copper Project consists of
248 BLM claims covering 20 acres each located on
Bureau of Land Management Federally administered
land and 3 State leases in application of 1mi2 each.
All indigenous title is cleared and there are no other
known historical or environmentally sensitive areas.

The security of the tenure held at the time of
reporting along with any known impediments to
obtaining a licence to operate in the area.

The claims have been granted and are subject to an
annual payment. Other than the payment there is no
requirement for minimum exploration or reporting.
There is no expiry date on the claims. State leases
are awaiting granting.

Geology

Deposit type, geological setting and style of
mineralisation.

At the Western Desert Project the company is
exploring for “Carlin type” carbonate hosted gold
mineralisation.

Drill hole
Information

A summary of all information material to the
understanding of the exploration results including a
tabulation of the following information for all
Material drill holes:
easting and northing of the drill hole collar elevation
or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar dip and azimuth of the
hole down hole length and interception depth hole
length.

All information as listed is provided in the preceding
tables.

If the exclusion of this information is justified on the
basis that the information is not Material and this
exclusion does not detract from the understanding of
the report, the Competent Person should clearly
explain why this is the case.

No information has been excluded.

In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging
techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade
truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off
grades are usually Material and should be stated.

No weighted averages have been used.

Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short
lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of
low-grade results, the procedure used for such
aggregation should be stated and some typical
examples of such aggregations should be shown in
detail.

No aggregate intercepts are reported.

The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.

No metal equivalent values are stated.

Relationship
between
mineralization
widths and
intercept
lengths

These relationships are particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results. If the geometry of
the
mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle is
known, its nature should be reported.

Where thickness are stated from the rock chip
sampling the intercepts reflect the true thickness as
the samples were taken at near right angles to the
mineralisation.

If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are
reported, there should be a clear statement to this
effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not
known’).

No drilling was completed.

Diagrams

Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and
tabulations of intercepts should be included for any
significant discovery being reported. These should
include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole
collar locations and appropriate sectional views.

Appropriate maps are included.

Balanced
reporting

Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable, representative reporting of
both low and high grades and/or widths should be

This release includes results to date from the rock chip
sampling, stream sediment sampling and soil sampling
from the Western Desert Gold Copper Project.

practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration
Results.

Other
substantive
exploration
data

Other exploration data, if meaningful and material,
should be reported including (but not
limited to): geological
observations; geophysical survey results;
geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential deleterious or
contaminating substances.

At Western Desert the geology is a sequence of
Carboniferous carbonates overthrust on an older
sequence of predominantly carbonate and
sediments. No metallurgical test-work, geophysical
surveys or bulk sampling has been undertaken.

Further work

The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g.
tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or
large-scale step-out drilling).

At Western Desert further stream sediment
geochemistry and reconnaissance mapping is planned.
