ALCOA LIME SUPPY CONTRACT UPDATE

Adbri Limited (Adbri or the Company) (ASX: ABC) announces that its subsidiary, Cockburn Cement Limited, has been
informed by Alcoa of Australia Limited (Alcoa) that it has elected not to renew its current lime supply contract expiring on
30 June 2021.
The contract constitutes approximately $70 million in annual revenue for the Group, and its non-renewal is not expected
to materially impact revenue until post June 2021. The Company will promptly evaluate and take necessary mitigating
actions. Consequently, it is not possible to quantify the full financial impact of the non-renewal at this stage.
Adbri CEO Nick Miller said: “We are disappointed with Alcoa’s decision to displace locally manufactured product with
imports from multiple sources, particularly considering our almost 50-year uninterrupted supply relationship. We will work
quickly to mitigate the impact on local jobs supporting our lime business and we remain committed to supplying our WA
resources sector customers.”

Authorised for release by the Board.
