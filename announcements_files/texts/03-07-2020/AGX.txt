Distributions for unitholders who have not made an election to participate in the Distribution
Reinvestment Plan (DRP) by 5pm on 1 July 2020 will be automatically reinvested in accordance with
the DRP Rules, available at the Antipodes Partners AGX1 website.
AGX1 is adopting direct crediting of distribution payments as this is a more secure and convenient
way to receive payments. Unitholders who have elected not to participate in the DRP but have not
provided their Australian financial institution account details will have their distribution payments set
aside and retained on their behalf. To avoid distribution payments being delayed, unitholders should
provide their payment instructions to the unit registry before the Record Date.

Yours faithfully,
