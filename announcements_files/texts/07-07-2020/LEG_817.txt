Legend Mining Limited (Legend) is pleased to provide assay results from diamond drillholes
RKDD015 and RKDD018 at the Mawson prospect within the Rockford Project, Fraser Range,
Western Australia (see Figure 4). The results are discussed in detail in the body of this
announcement.
Legend Managing Director Mr Mark Wilson said: “The grades of the 4.5m intercept of 3% nickel,
2.3% copper and 0.19% cobalt in hole 18 are the best grades to date at Mawson. The other assays
for this hole and hole 15 generally add to the robust grades and widths reported at Mawson.
“As I have previously commented, the mineralisation is open to the southwest, northeast and east
and requires further analysis of all datasets prior to planning step-out drillholes.”

TECHNICAL DISCUSSION
Assay results have been received from diamond drillholes RKDD015 and RKDD018 at Mawson
(see Figure 1 & Tables 1 & 2). Both holes were drilled to follow up significant Ni-Cu sulphide
mineralisation intersected previously in RKDD007 and RKDD008 (see announcements 26 May and
30 June 2020).

RKDD018
RKDD018 was designed to test the eastern extension of sulphide mineralisation in both the upper
disseminated and lower massive sulphide intervals intersected in RKDD008 (see Figure 2). Assays
reported a 19.2m interval with 1.69% Ni and 1.23% Cu from 97.9m associated with an upper
mafic/ultramafic intrusive with massive, brecciated and disseminated sulphides all displaying a
strong supergene overprint. This interval contains a high grade 4.5m zone returning 3.05% Ni and
2.32% Cu and 0.19% Co, with maximum values of 4.14% Ni (0.8m) and 5.25% Cu (0.7m) (see
Table 3).
A second 34.65m interval of heavy disseminated and blebby/disseminated sulphide occurs at
130.7m downhole and is associated with the top of the lower mafic intrusive (see Figure 2).

RKDD015
Diamond drillhole RKDD015 was designed to test the northern extension of massive sulphide
mineralisation in RKDD011 and the eastern extension of the upper sulphide zone in RKDD007 (see
Figure 3).
RKDD015 intersected an upper 73.5m sulphide bearing mafic/ultramafic intrusive and returned an
intersection of 73.5m @ 0.32% Ni and 0.29% Cu from 87.5m. A second intersection of 24.3m @
0.22% Ni and 0.26% Cu from 279.0m downhole is associated with the lower mafic/ultramafic
intrusive (see Figure 3).

Mawson Future Programmes
 Continue 3,000m RC drilling programme targeting known sulphide mineralisation, geochemical
anomalies and gravity features.
 Continue infill aircore drill programme across the greater Mawson area.
 Ongoing integration of RC, aircore and gravity datasets to assist future diamond drillhole
planning/design.

JORC Code Explanation
• These relationships are
particularly important in the
reporting of Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the
mineralisation with respect to
the drill hole angle is known, its
nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the
down hole lengths are reported,
there should be a clear
statement to this effect (e.g.
‘down hole length, true width
not known’).
• Appropriate maps and sections
(with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included
for any significant discovery
being reported. These should
include, but not be limited to a
plan view of drill hole collar
locations and appropriate
sectional views.
• Where comprehensive
reporting of all Exploration
Results is not practicable,
representative reporting of both
low and high grades and/or
widths should be practiced to
avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.
• Other exploration data, if
meaningful and material,
should be reported including
(but not limited to): geological
observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical
survey results; bulk samples –
size and method of treatment;
metallurgical test results; bulk
density, groundwater,
geotechnical and rock
characteristics; potential
deleterious or contaminating
substances.
• The nature and scale of
planned further work (e.g. tests
for lateral extensions or depth
extensions or large-scale stepout drilling).
• Diagrams clearly highlighting
the areas of possible
extensions, including the main
geological interpretations and
future drilling areas, provided
this information is not
commercially sensitive.

Commentary
 The drill core has been oriented to
enable structural logging and
evaluation of true thicknesses of the
mineralised intervals.
 Drillhole intercepts/intervals are
measured downhole in metres.

 Project and drillhole location maps

in the body of the report.

 Assay results presented are

 Detailed high quality aeromagnetic/
gravity datasets, aircore drilling

surveys used to target drilling.
 Downhole EM surveying was
completed in drillholes RKDD015 &

 Continued geological, geophysical
