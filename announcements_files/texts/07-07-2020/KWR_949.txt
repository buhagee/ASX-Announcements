Diamond core and RC drilling has been completed at Menzies for the first
half of 2020. Drilling has intersected new high-grade lodes in first pass
drilling within the Central Zone as well high-grade intercepts that extend
the known mineralisation at the Stirling Prospect and at Yunndaga Deeps.
Highlights include:


3.0m @ 6.66 g/t Au from 24m in KWR048



3.0m @ 6.05 g/t Au from 61m in KWR042



6.0m @ 3.41 g/t Au from 142m in KWR047



2.0m @ 11.27 g/t Au from 51m in KWR044



1.1m @ 5.74 g/t Au from 759.2m in KWD014W3

Optimisation Studies of near surface Mineral Resources
underway

Kingwest Resources Ltd (ASX: KWR) (“Kingwest” or “the Company”) is
pleased to announce additional results from recently completed drilling
programmes at the Menzies Gold Project (MGP).
Ed Turner, CEO, commented:
“We are very pleased that first pass drilling within the Central Zone has
discovered numerous new gold lodes that add to our known deposits.
Drilling at other targets has also resulted in extending significant high-grade
mineralisation at Stirling and Yunndaga.
Earlier drilling at Menzies within the same programme have returned 1.0m
@ 25.4g/t Au from 731.5m in KWRD014 (deepest hole drilled in the Menzies
Gold Project to date), 0.9m @ 36.6g/t Au from 172.7m in KWD026, 0.8m @
33.5g/t Au from 108.2m in KWRD019, 3m @ 158.4g/t Au from 180m in
KWR023 and 5m @ 13.1 g/t Au from 32m in KWR009.
KWR has a dominant landholding in the Menzies region, which has
historically produced 643,200 oz @ 22.5g/t Au2 from underground (U/G)
between 1895 and 1943 plus 145,000 oz @ 2.6g/t Au2 open cut between
1995 and 1999, for a total of 787,200 oz @ 18.9g/t2 Au. The fact that we
have intercepted significant mineralization in the majority of the holes we
have drilled makes us increasingly confident the MGP can again be a longterm high-grade gold producing province. Optimisation studies are now
underway in order to advance the known Mineral Resources towards
production.”

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
The results from the 2020 diamond core drilling again confirm the high-grade nature of the
mineralisation at MGP. A full list of significant intersections is included in Table 1 and drill hole details
in Table 2 (N.B. these tables also include holes and assays previously announced in 2020). Two more
diamond core directional wedges were drilled beneath the Princess May workings at Yunndaga with
significant intersections in both. Follow up drilling at Stirling Prospect, which is part of the Lady
Shenton system, also provided high grade intersections and inaugural drilling within the Central Zone
returned numerous significant intersections (see Figure 1 for location plan).

Figure 1: 2020 MGP drilling location plan

Lady Shenton
Eight RC holes (KWR038 – 045) were completed at the Stirling Prospect, which lies to the west of the
Lady Shenton pit, for a total of 636 metres. These holes were designed to follow up previous highgrade results including 5m @ 13.1g/t Au from 32m in KWRD009 and 2.9m @ 5.8g/t Au from 52m in
KWD027.
The best intersections were 3.0m @ 6.05 g/t Au from 61m, inc. 1.0m @ 10.72 g/t Au from 61m in
KWR042 and 2.0m @ 11.27 g/t Au from 50m, inc. 1.0m @ 17.44 g/t Au from 51m in KWR044 (see
Figure 2). These intersections add length and depth extensions to the previous high-grade
intersections and enable KWR to now plan resource definition drilling at Stirling.
A full list of significant intersections is included in Table 1 and drill hole details are included in Table
2.

Central Zone Drilling
Nineteen RC holes (KWR026 – 037 and KWR046 - 052) were drilled in the Central Zone for a total of
3,210 metres. This is the first testing of the Central Zone by KWR and was designed to test structural
targets that are coincidental with numerous lines of historic workings.
The best intersections were 1.0m @ 7.13 g/t Au from 16m in KWR030, 3.0m @ 4.19 g/t Au from
42m, inc. 1.0m @ 7.37 g/t Au from 43m in KWR033, 6.0m @ 3.41 g/t Au from 142m, inc. 1.0m @
10.88 g/t Au from 142m and 1.0m @ 7.85 g/t Au from 147m in KWR047 and 3.0m @ 6.66 g/t Au
from 24m, inc. 1.0m @ 10.61 g/t Au from 24m in KWR048 (see Figure 3). These early results confirm
that the Central Zone includes numerous mineralised bodies that require further investigation.

A full list of significant intersections is included in Table 1 and drill hole details are included in Table
2.

Yunndaga
Two diamond core directional holes (KWRD014W2 and KWRD014W3) were drilled as wedges from the
KWRD014 parent hole for a combined 828.80 metres. These were targeting deeper extensions to the
Princess May shoot as KWD014 did which returned 1.03m @ 25.40g/t Au from 733.47m (as reported
to the ASX on June 1, 2020).
KWD014W2 intersected 0.68m @ 5.1 g/t Au from 735.71m (N.B. this is the result from the second half
of the core cut for this interval, the other half returned an assay of 0.58g/t Au which once again shows
the highly variable nature of the coarse gold within the MGP), 0.80m @ 3.61g/t Au from 752.70m and
2.07m @ 2.19 g/t Au from 756.41m. KWD014W3 intersected 1.10m @ 5.74 g/t Au from 759.22m,
1.00m @ 2.53 g/t Au from 778.86m and 1.02m @ 3.66 g/t Au from 785.78m. A full list of significant
intersections is included in Table 1 and drill hole details are included in Table 2. Figure 4 is a long section
showing the pierce points into the Princess May shoot.
Significant mineralisation has now been extended more than 100m below the lowest Princess May
Shoot underground workings (Level 21) and remains open at depth and along strike in both directions.

Mineral Resources Optimisation Studies
Optimisation Studies of all Mineral Resources at Menzies (Table 3) have commenced to determine the likely
economic viability of each deposit. Infill drilling of the best resources will be planned to upgrade the levels of
confidence from Inferred to Indicated or Measured Resources and these will lead into Scoping Studies in the
second half on 2020.
Additional Mineral Resource Estimates (MRE’s) are also being undertaken for the near surface mineralised
deposits that have not had previous MRE’s completed.

Forward-Looking Statements
This document may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
statements concerning Kingwest Resources Limited’s planned exploration program and other statements that are not
historical facts. When used in this document, the words such as "could," "plan," "expect," "intend," "may”, "potential,"
"should," and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Although Kingwest believes that its expectations reflected
in these forward- looking statements are reasonable, such statements involve risks and uncertainties and no assurance can
be given that further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource.
Competent Person Statement
The information in this report that relates to 2020 Exploration Results and the stated Exploration Targets is based on
information compiled by Mr Peter Spitalny who is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr
Spitalny is a consultant Geologist to Kingwest Resources Limited. Mr Spitalny has sufficient experience that is relevant to the
style of mineralisation, type of deposit under consideration and to the activity that they are undertaking to qualify as a
Competent Person as defined in the 2012 edition of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results and consents
to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which they appear.
With reference to previously reported Exploration and Mineral Resources results, the company confirms that it is not aware
of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original market announcement and, in
the case of estimates of Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves that all material assumptions and technical parameters
underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. The
company confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Person’s findings are presented have not been materially
modified from the original market announcement.

ABOUT THE MGP
Menzies is one of Western Australia’s major historic gold fields. Located 130km north of the globally
significant gold deposits of Kalgoorlie (Figure 5).

Figure 5: MGP location.

For personal use only

The MGP covers a contiguous land package over a strike length in excess of 15km. Within the MGP a
series of structurally controlled high-grade gold deposits have been historically mined and display
extensive exploration potential for high-grade extensions. Modern exploration since closure over 20
years ago has been limited.
The MGP is hosted along the Menzies Shear Zone. All deposits lie within granted Mining Leases and
are 100% owned by KWR.
The MGP has recorded historical production of 643,200 oz @ 22.5g/t Au2 from underground (U/G)
between 1895 and 1943 plus 145,000 oz @ 2.6g/t Au2 open cut between 1995 and 1999, for a total
of 787,200 oz @ 18.9g/t2 Au.
Importantly the MGP lies only 130km north of Kalgoorlie on the Goldfields Highway, has power and
water and is within trucking distance of numerous Gold Processing Plants.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data

Criteria

JORC Code explanation

Sampling
techniques

 Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut

channels, random chips, or specific specialised
industry standard measurement tools
appropriate to the minerals under
investigation, such as down hole gamma
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc).

These examples should not be taken as
limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure
sample representivity and the appropriate

calibration of any measurement tools or
systems used.
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation
that are Material to the Public Report.

 In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has
been done this would be relatively simple (eg
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain
1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised

to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In
other cases more explanation may be
required, such as where there is coarse gold
that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual
commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of
detailed information.
 Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open
hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka,
sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple
or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, facesampling bit or other type, whether core is
oriented and if so, by what method, etc).

The 2020 drilling program by Kingwest
Resources (KWR) includes Reverse Circulation
(RC) and Diamond (DD) drilling. The majority
of drill holes have a dip of -60° towards the
north east.
Industry standard RC and DD drilling and
sampling protocols for lode and supergene
gold deposits have been utilised throughout
the campaign.
RC holes were sampled using 4m
composite spear samples, with individual 1
metre samples later submitted for assay
based on the initial composite assay result.
DD holes sample intervals ranged from
0.3m – 1.5m (averaging 0.5 m within
mineralised zones and 1 m outside) and
were based on geological logging.
Samples were submitted to SGS
Laboratories in Kalgoorlie where the entire
sample was pulverised, split and assayed by
fire assay using a 50 gram charge.

 Method of recording and assessing core and
chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery
and ensure representative nature of the
samples.
 Whether a relationship exists between sample
recovery and grade and whether sample bias
may have occurred due to preferential
loss/gain of fine/coarse material.

RC sample recovery was qualitatively
assessed by comparing drill chip volumes
(sample bags) for individual meters. Sample
depths were routinely crossed checked
every rod (6m). The cyclone was regularly
cleaned to ensure no material build up and
sample material was checked for any potential
downhole contamination. All samples were
dry. In the CP’s opinion the drilling sample
recoveries/quality are acceptable and are
appropriately representative for the style of
mineralisation.
All DD core was measured for recovery and
RQD. Recovery was excellent at almost

Commentary

Drilling by KWR was predominantly
diamond core (DD) with Reverse Circulation
(RC) pre collars. DD core is a mix of HQ and
NQ diameter. All core was systematically
oriented during drilling using a Reflex ACT
Mk.3TM core orientation tool. Holes depths
range from 48 to 480 m.

No grade versus sample recovery biases, or
biases relating the loss or gain of fines have
been identified at the project to the date. It
is possible that there may be some minor
biases in the diamond core around the stope
and in the RC portions of the holes. Most
mineralised intervals reported here are
from DD drilling.
RC holes were logged on one metre
intervals at the rig by the geologist from drill
chips. All drill core was logged
geologically and geotechnically in
detail sufficient to support Mineral
Resource estimates, mining and
metallurgical studies. Logging included
lithology, texture, veining, grain size,
structure,
alteration,
hardness,
fracture density, RQD, alteration,
mineralisation, magnetic response
Logging was recorded either on standard
logging descriptive sheets or directly into
Excel tables or in LogChief. Drill logs were
compiled into Datashed.
Logging is qualitative in nature. All core was
photographed.
100% of all meterage’s were geologically
logged.
For RC drilling single 1 metre splits were
automatically taken at the time of drilling by
a cone splitter attached to the cyclone.
Duplicate splits were taken every 10 metres.
4 metre composite samples were collected
from the drill rig by spearing each 1m
collection bag. The 4 metre composites
were submitted for assay. The 1 metre split
samples were later sent for assay based on
the 4 m composite sample results.
No duplicate 4m samples were taken for RC
samples.
All core was appropriately orientated and
marked up for sampling by company
geologists prior to core cutting. Sample
widths range from 0.3m to 1.5m. Half core
samples were submitted to the commercial
laboratories in Kalgoorlie for analysis.
Sample preparation comprised industry
standard oven drying, crushing, and
pulverisation to less than 75 microns.
Homogenised pulp material was used for
assaying
Samples volumes were typically 2.0-4.0 kg
and are considered to be of suitable size

Blank samples were routinely dispatched to
the laboratory to monitor sample
preparation. These generally performed
within acceptable tolerances.
Duplicate coarse reject or bulk pulverised
reject samples have been submitted for
assay to cross check assay repeatability.
Results show variation typically of coarse
grain “nuggety” gold deposits.
The RC 1m split and 4m composite as well
as the core samples were assayed by Fire
Assay (FAA50) by SGS Laboratory in
Kalgoorlie for gold.
Results from geophysical tools are not
reported here.
KWR uses industry standard data collection
and QC protocols. Laboratory QC (Quality
Control) involves the use of internal lab
standards, certified reference material,
blanks, splits and replicates. QC results
(blanks, coarse reject duplicates,
standards) are monitored and were within
acceptable limits. Approximately 10% of
samples submitted were QC samples.
QC assays reported within acceptable
tolerances. Of note is that coarse reject or
bulk pulverised reject duplicate assays show
variation from the original primary assays
typically of the “nuggety” style of gold
mineralisation found at the project
Significant intersections were cross checked
against core photos and drill logs after
drilling.
Several twin holes are planned to verify
historic drilling intersections.
Data storage is as PDF/XLS files which are
then migrated into a Datashed database.
KWR is currently in the process of validating
and cross-checking historical project data
which will be migrated into the new Datashed
database.
No data was adjusted.
All drill collar locations were initially
surveyed using a hand-held Garmin GPS,
accurate to within 3-5m. Holes were drilled
on a grid lines at some prospects and as one
hole on different northings at other
prospects.
The grid system used is MGA94 Zone 51. All
reported coordinates are referenced to this
grid. The topography was relatively flat.



Topography is almost flat, small differences
in elevation between drill holes will have
little effect on mineralisation widths on
initial interpretation. A high resolution
(~1m) topography has been created from
Landgate imagery.

 Data spacing for reporting of Exploration
Results.
 Whether the data spacing and distribution is
sufficient to establish the degree of geological
and grade continuity appropriate for the
Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation
procedure(s) and classifications applied.
 Whether sample compositing has been
applied.
 Whether the orientation of sampling achieves
unbiased sampling of possible structures and
the extent to which this is known, considering
the deposit type.
 If the relationship between the drilling
orientation and the orientation of key
mineralised structures is considered to have
introduced a sampling bias, this should be
assessed and reported if material.
 The measures taken to ensure sample security.



Holes are variably spaced ranging from 5
metres to 100m spacing.
No resource is reported here. The data
spacing is appropriate for the reporting of
exploration results.
There has been no sample compositing
done.
