Ampolex Report PEP11 -Baleen

A further key report on the PEP11 area prepared by Ampolex Limited was identified from a
literature review. This report was one of the studies which were produced by prior tenement joint
holders, Santos and Ampolex.
Ampolex reported that:
• The Baleen South Lead was one of their major targets
• The primary source rocks ….could provide a viable, mature, gas / condensate source along
the length of the Offshore Uplift

The material below is extracted from the Ampolex study released in 1992 on the Offshore Sydney
Basin. “Evolution and Hydrocarbon Prospectivity of the Offshore Sydney Basin NSW P10 “G.
Bradley August 1992 (*P10 is now covered by PEP11area)
Baleen Lead
• The Baleen South Lead is located about 20 km offshore (some 30 km south-southeast of
Newcastle) on the crest of the “Offshore Uplift”
• The Structure was mapped with 1991 seismic data.
• The closure has 200 msec of relief (850 to 1050 ms TWT) and is bounded on its west by the
main thrust controlling the Offshore Uplift
• The primary source rocks , the late Permian Coal Measures, are inferred to be more
extensive ,and could provide a viable, mature, gas /condensate source along the length of
the Offshore Uplift
• The primary target reservoir in the offshore Sydney Basin is the Hawkesbury Sandstone
• Excellent top seal would be provided by Wianamatta Group shales and or Newport
Formation Tidal shales
• The Sydney Basis is part of a much larger foreland basin which once extended from
Queensland (Bowen Basin )southwards through the Sydney -Gunnedah Basins to the Nilsen
-Mackey Basin

Further Seismic Surveys
This report was produced after further seismic was conducted in the PEP11 permit area in 1991,
2004, and 2017. All early seismic acquired in PEP11 has been reprocessed.
