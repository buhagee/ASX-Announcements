Sezzle Inc. (ASX:​SZL​) (​Sezzle or ​Company​) // Installment payment platform, Sezzle, is
pleased to release key operating metrics for the quarter ended 30 June 2020 (​2Q20​) and
provide annualized UMS guidance. Despite global economic headwinds stemming from
COVID-19, Sezzle’s results continue to reflect a trajectory of solid growth across all key
operating metrics. The utility of the Company’s product is apparent in higher repeat
usage rates (87.5% compared to 77.2% 2Q19) and purchase frequency by cohorts
approaching 15x per annum.

“In these uncertain times, we are fortunate to announce record Q2 results across a
number of our key metrics,​” said Sezzle’s Executive Chairman and CEO Charlie Youakim.
“Our performance reaffirms our product’s utility to consumers looking for a smarter way
to budget their personal finances and the overall market shift to eCommerce.”

Improving consumer profile
North American consumers and retailers continue to turn to eCommerce for their needs
as the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to dissipate. With nearly 100% of Sezzle’s transactions
via eCommerce, the Company is well-positioned for the ongoing move to online. For
example, 2Q20 represented the top 3 months of monthly UMS in the Company’s history.
Even though growth has been significant, it has been at a responsible pace, as leading
loss indicators continue to show YoY and sequential improvement.
“Our strong performance in Q2 is reflective of an improving consumer profile combined
with an accelerated adoption of eCommerce due to the pandemic,” noted Mr. Youakim.
“The undercurrent of organic growth that we are experiencing is exciting to see as our
business matures. The gains in repeat customer usage and frequency of purchases by
cohorts are key drivers to lower loss rates and greater net transaction margin (NTM).”
●

Repeat usage improved over 10 points YoY to 87.5% for June 2020 compared to
77.2% in June 2019. The performance in June 2020 also represented the 18th
straight month of sequential improvement.

Purchase frequency by cohort reveals that older cohorts continue to use
Sezzle at an increasing rate over time. The brand loyalty is reflected in the 2018
cohort, as the group is now at a pace of approximately 15 transactions per
year. The 2019 (9x per year) and 2020 (5x per year) cohorts, while not as mature,
show greater activity than the 2018 cohort at related points in time. Similarly,
the 2020 cohort is showing a better pace than the 2019 cohort.

Sezzle’s CDIs are issued in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in
Regulation S of the US Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) for offers of securities which
are made outside the US. Accordingly, the CDIs have not been, and will not be, registered
under the Securities Act or the laws of any state or other jurisdiction in the US. As a result
of relying on the Regulation S exemption, the CDIs are ‘restricted securities’ under Rule
144 of the Securities Act. This means that you are unable to sell the CDIs into the US or to
a US person who is not a QIB for the foreseeable future except in very limited
circumstances until after the end of the restricted period, unless the re-sale of the CDIs is
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption is available. To enforce the above
transfer restrictions, all CDIs issued bear a FOR Financial Product designation on the
ASX. This designation restricts any CDIs from being sold on ASX to US persons excluding
QIBs. However, you are still able to freely transfer your CDIs on ASX to any person other
than a US person who is not a QIB. In addition, hedging transactions with regard to the
CDIs may only be conducted in accordance with the Securities Act.
