TRADING HALT REQUEST

LBT Innovations Limited (“LBT” or the “Company”) (ASX: LBT) requests a halt be placed on its securities
immediately in accordance with Listing Rule 17.1, pending an announcement in respect of a capital raise.
It is anticipated that the capital raise will be partly used to provide additional funds for the expansion of sales
activities in Europe, in tandem with the appointment of Beckman Coulter announced earlier this morning.
LBT is not aware of any reason that a trading halt should not be placed on its securities. The trading halt is
expected to be lifted by no later than commencement of trading on Thursday, 9 July 2020, pending release of
an announcement by the Company in relation to the capital raising.
