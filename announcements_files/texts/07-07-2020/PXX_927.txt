Extension of Share Purchase Plan
PolarX Limited (ASX: PXX) (‘PolarX’ or the ‘Company’) advises that the closing date for its Share
Purchase Plan (SPP) has been extended to 5.00pm (AEST) on Friday, 10 July 2020 from the previous
closing date of 8 July 2020. The Company has decided to extend the closing date following receipt of
a number of enquiries from eligible shareholders interested in participating, who have experienced
delays in receipt of their SPP offer booklet due to longer postal delivery times related to COVID-19
restrictions.
Eligible shareholders wishing to participate in the SPP should apply by completing the personalised
acceptance form sent to all eligible Shareholders or in the case of applying by BPay®, using the
Reference Number shown on the application form. Eligible shareholders may also electronically
access and securely download their personalised forms from Computershare’s Investor Centre
website at www.investorcentre.com by logging in as an Existing User or clicking on Access a Single
Holding and following the instructions.
Under the SPP, eligible shareholders will be entitled to acquire up to $30,000 of Shares at an issue
price of $0.038 per Share, being the same issue price as the placement which completed on 23 June
2020.
Applications and payment must now be received by 5.00pm (AEST) on Friday, 10 July 2020. The issue
date for Shares under the SPP is now expected to be 17 July 2020, with the new Shares expected to
commence trading on 20 July 2020.
