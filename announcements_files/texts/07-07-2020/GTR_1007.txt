Acquisition Doubles Jeffrey Project, Extends Trend to 5.5km and GTI Raises Capital
Highlights
▪ GTI doubles Jeffrey & Rats Nest project area by acquiring adjacent past producing mineral leases

that join together the existing claims groups in the Henry Mountains Utah, USA.
▪ The acquired leases are highly prospective for near surface uranium & vanadium mineralisation &

materially extend ownership across a now contiguous interpreted mineralised trend of over 5.5km.
▪ Recent XRF sampling from historical shallow underground workings on the leases provides

evidence of potential high-grade uranium & vanadium mineralisation with XRF results up to
81,745ppm for uranium and 28,375ppm vanadium.
▪ Exploration planning for the next phase of drilling in Utah is underway targeting Q3 field activity.
▪ Further field work planned on the Niagara (Kookynie) gold project in WA.
▪ GTI has commenced raising $1,811,289 via a placement at 3¢ per Share and will undertake a Share

Purchase Plan, partially underwritten by CPS Capital Group Pty Ltd (CPS) to $978,000.

GTI Resources Ltd (GTI or the Company) is pleased to advise that it has entered into a binding agreement
to acquire 100% of two mineral leases from TSX.V listed Anfield Energy Inc. (Anfield). The two
strategically located mineral leases (the Properties) serve to connect the Company’s current ground
positions in the area and more than doubles the size of GTI’s land position in the area by conjoining the
Company’s most prospective projects at Jeffrey and Rats Nest (Figure 1). GTI’s contiguous land position
has now been expanded to over 5.5km along the interpreted strike of the mineralised trend with
significant exploration upside within untested areas under cover.
The new leases contain historical underground production workings and are prospective for uranium
and vanadium as evidenced from recent sampling, conducted during acquisition due diligence, which
yielded in-field XRF measurements of up to 81,745ppm U and 28,375ppm V (Figure 1, Table 1).
The recent reconnaissance drill program at Jeffrey targeted known shallow mineralisation in a nearsurface sandstone unit of the lower Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. The drilling also
explored slightly deeper (to circa 20m from surface) sandstone units within the fluvial depositional
sequence which lead to identification of uranium mineralisation of economic interest in a second, slightly
deeper, sandstone unit. This discovery substantially increases the potential of the Jeffrey project to host
meaningful uranium and vanadium resources, similar in character to regional historical production. The
mineralised trend is clearly open to the south, with known mineralisation on the property line between
the Jeffrey project claims and ML 535991, one of the leases GTI is acquiring from Anfield (Figure 1, Figure
2).

GTI Executive Director, Bruce Lane said, “these new properties have helped GTI build a significantly enhanced
ground position by securing the prospective ground between our Jeffrey and Rats Nest claim groups. The new
ground substantially increases the interpreted mineralised strike zone within GTI’s land package and materially
enhances the opportunity to define an economic resource in the area. The mineralised trend which was
confirmed during our recent round of drilling at Jeffrey remains open in both directions and in particular to the
south which runs into the new leases. The initial sampling conducted on the new leases shows prospectivity for
commercial grade ores and the possibility that exploration and development could be relatively quick and
inexpensive.”
Manager of GTI’s exploration program, Matt Hartmann said, “The recently completed drilling at Jeffrey was
undertaken to test our interpretation of the mineralised horizon and to better understand the trend of the
mineralised envelope. The results clearly showed us that not only did the mineralisation run into the
neighbouring ground but that there was a second, deeper mineralised horizon in the southern area of the Jeffrey
group adjacent to the neighbouring property. The mineralisation in the newly acquired property appears to be
consistent with the historically mined mineralisation within the Salt Wash Member across the Colorado Plateau.
We are now consolidating our understanding of the local mineralised system and planning the next phase of
exploration. We are very encouraged by our exploration results to date and excited that we have been able to
secure the neighbouring leases. GTI plans to expand the scope of its drilling activity as quickly as possible to
include the newly acquired property.”

Due Diligence Sampling
GTI has completed technical due diligence on the two mineral leases including collection of a number of
XRF analyses to characterise exposed uranium and vanadium mineralisation. The XRF data covers in-field
analysis on underground exposures on mineralisation within Mineral Lease ML 53599 and Rats Nest Claim
#1. Due to the west-northwest dip and limited surface exposures of the Salt Wash Member across Mineral
Lease ML 52627, underground exposures immediately to the east in Rats Nest Claim #1 were analysed to
characterise the nature of mineralisation within this unit that projects under cover. Results from the infield XRF analysis were as high as 81,745ppm U and 28,375ppm V within ML 53599, and 34,258ppm U &
47,441ppm V within Rats Nest Claim #1 (Table 1).
XRF analysis were completed with a Bruker S1 Titan portable XRF machine, calibrated to industry
standards. The XRF was utilised to analyse exposed mineralisation within historical underground
workings. Analysed samples were unprepared, representing random, fresh rock chips devoid of obvious
surficial oxide minerals that tend to skew XRF readings. The XRF analyses represent the nature of
mineralisation and estimation of grade, but do not represent formal assays and have not been verified by
an independent laboratory. Assay samples within the historical underground workings will be collected
in the future for laboratory analysis following a structured QA/QC program.

Jeffrey Project

For personal use only

As previously reported on 2 July 20202, the drilling program at the Jeffrey project successfully achieved
the drilling and down-hole gamma logging of 12 new drill holes and a further 6 historical drill holes located
near the newly drilled holes (Figure 1).
The results of the downhole gamma logging returned high in situ assay values up to 3,535ppm eU3O8. In
addition, field screening of the drill core with a handheld XRF has yielded results up to 26,388 ppm
vanadium. The completed drilling has confirmed the projected geometry of the mineralised trend, with
the trend remaining open in both directions along strike. Laboratory assay of the drill core is pending,
and those results will be released when available.
The next exploration phase is expected to entail a larger drill program, targeting potential development
of a shallow JORC code compliant mineral resource, and would ultimately inform future production
studies. The shallow nature of the mineralisation supports continued low-cost, rapid exploration
advancements.

Commentary

• Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or
specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate
to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma
sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
• Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity
& the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems
used.
• Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the
Public Report.
• In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be
relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1
m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge
for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required,
such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling
problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg
submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
• Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air
blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple
or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other
type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
• Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries
and results assessed.
• Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure
representative nature of the samples.

• XRF analyses were completed on fresh surfaces of random rock
chips devoid of obvious surficial oxide minerals.
• No sample preparation (grinding, crushing, etc.) was completed prior
to XRF analysis.
• The portable XRF utilized for analysis was calibrated to industry
standards.

• No drilling was completed.

• No drilling was completed.

• Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in
situ material collected, including for instance results for field
duplicate/second-half sampling.
• Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material
being sampled.
• The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and

of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.
• The verification of significant intersections by either independent or
alternative company personnel.
• The use of twinned holes.

Commentary

• Underground exposures sampled for XRF analysis were descriptively
logged for future reference.

• Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data
verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.
• Discuss any adjustment to assay data.
• Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and
down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations
used in Mineral Resource estimation.
• Specification of the grid system used.
• Quality and adequacy of topographic control.
• Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.
• Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the
degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral
Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and
classifications applied.
• Whether sample compositing has been applied.
• Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of
possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering
the deposit type.
• If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation
of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a
sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.

Commentary

• Sampled underground adits were surveyed with a Trimble Geo 7x
GPS, with +/- 0.3m accuracy for northing and easting.
• Topographic Control is from GPS. Accuracy +/- 0.5m
• The NAD 83, UTM meters, Utah Meridian 26 datum is used as the
coordinate system
• Spatial distribution of sampling was random and driven by access to
mineralised section in historical underground developments.

• No drilling was completed. No analysis of samples against geologic
structures was completed.

• The measures taken to ensure sample security.

• All samples were analysed in the field.

• The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.

• No audits or reviews have been undertaken on the XRF data.
• The calibration data & data collection methods were reviewed &
verified by the CP.

Commentary

• Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including
agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint
ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests,
historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental
settings.
• The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any
known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.

• Data presented in this release comes from the Rats Nest Project, and
SITLA Mineral Lease ML 53599.
• The Rats Nest project consists of 14 unpatented federal lode mineral
claims owned (100%) by Voyager energy LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of GTI Resources Ltd. The project is located approximately
35 km south of Hanksville, Utah, on the eastern flank of the Henry
Mountains.
• All claims are in good standing.
• Mineral Lease ML 53599 is administered by the State of Utah School
and Institutional Trust Lands Administration. The lease is currently
subject of a binding agreement between Anfield Energy Inc. and GTI for
its acquisition.
• Exploration and very small-scale production of uranium and vanadium
occurred until the late 1970s to early 1980s. Little information and/or
data is available from these activities.

• Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.

Information

• Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.

• A summary of all information material to the understanding of the
exploration results including a tabulation of the following information
for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in
metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.

• Uranium and vanadium deposits associated with fluvial channels and
reducing environments (high carbon) within fluvial sandstones,
siltstones and conglomerates. (sandstone-type uranium deposits with
associated vanadium)
• No drill hole data is reported.

JORC Code explanation
• If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the
information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from
the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly
explain why this is the case.
• In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques,
maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high
grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
• Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade
results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used
for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of
such aggregations should be shown in detail.
• The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values
should be clearly stated.
• These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of
Exploration Results.
• If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole
angle is known, its nature should be reported.
• If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there
should be a clear statement to this effect (eg ‘down hole length, true
width not known’).

Commentary

• No data aggregation, weighting, or other treatment was applied to the
XRF data.

• No drilling was completed. No mineralized thicknesses are reported.

exploration

• Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of
intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being
reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of
drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.
• Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not
practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades
and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of
Exploration Results.
• Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported
including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical
survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and
method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density,

• XRF results are discussed and reported in the text. XRF data are
reported in Table 1. XRF sample location are shown in Figure 1.
• All available results have been reported

• All available results have been reported
