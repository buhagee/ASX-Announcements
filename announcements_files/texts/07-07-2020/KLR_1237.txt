ASX Announcement
7th July 2020

SITE WORK FOR DRILLING COLLAR PEGGING AND HERITAGE SURVEYS COMPLETED
GINDALBIE GOLD PROJECT, YILGARN CRATON, WA
CANEGRASS (EL31/113) AND HOLY DAM (EL27/550)
Kaili Resources Limited (“Company”) advises completion of the field exploration activities,
announced on 11 June 2020, to prepare for a planned two thousand (2,000) metres Aircore
drilling at the Canegrass (EL31/113) and Holy Dam (EL27/550) tenements.
The contracted Kalgoorlie based crew have established collar and siter pegs for 50 proposed air
core drill holes at Holey Dam (HDAC001 to HDAC023) and Canegrass (CDAC001 to CGAC027).
On 24 June 2020, a Heritage Survey was completed at the Holey Dam and Canegrass tenements
and the final report states that there are no cultural issues at any of the sites and that drilling
can commence as planned.
The final Program of Works (POW) is being prepared for submission to the WA Department of
Mine Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS). Once the POW is approved, the drill site will be
prepared by the Gindalbie Hampton Hill Station Owners prior to mobilisation of the drilling rig
and crew. Drilling is planned to commence in the first half of August 2020 subject to unforeseen
events.
The proposed drill areas are shown in Figure 1 with areas F, B and E situated in Gindalbie Station
and area A in Hampton Hill Station.

Figure 1: Location of Holey Dam and Canegrass Proposed Drilling Areas

Canegrass
Drill testing of Area B in 2019 returned elevated gold in the range of 10 to 25 ppb in fold
axis/limbs settings. The area produced the highest gold response in the Canegrass vacuum drilling
program in 2019 and will be one of the areas to be tested by deeper drilling.
Areas B and F were highlighted for follow up by the RAB/Aircore drilling.
Up to 1,000 metres of angled RAB/Aircore drilling is planned within Areas B and F.
Holy Dam
Elevated gold from vacuum drilling in 2019 has been delineated in Areas A and E. Area A is located
at the intersection of two (2) regional structures, both intruded by Proterozoic dolerite dykes.
The intersection of NNW‐SSE structures with later E‐W structures is a good location for gold
mineralisation in the Yilgarn Craton.
Area E is located at the nose of folded/faulted adjacent to felsic volcanics to the west. There was
an elevated gold in quartz float result of 0.248 ppm Au from the vacuum drilling in 2019.
The Canegrass and Holy Dam 2019 drill results were contained in the Company’s ASX Releases of
12th and 17th September 2019.
