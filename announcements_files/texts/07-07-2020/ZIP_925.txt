Update on ZipTel’s acquisition of Douugh

ZipTel Limited (ASX: ZIP, “the Company”) refers to its previous announcements of 20 March
2020 and 30 March 2020 and is pleased to provide an update on the progress of the
acquisition of Douugh Ltd (DOU) (‘Transaction” or “Acquisition”).
The Company has received certain regulatory approvals and waivers from the ASX to
enable the Company to proceed to put the acquisition to shareholders for approval.
Following the receipt of shareholder approval, if obtained, the Company will apply to relist
on the ASX – currently anticipated for late August 2020.
Transaction details
Following discussion with the ASX, terms of the Transaction have changed as set out below:
1. ZIP will seek shareholder approval to undertake a 1.1 for 2 consolidation of its
capital (Consolidation) based on its previous 20 day trading low of 1.1 cents;
(previously this was a consolidation of 7.15 for every 10 shares)
2. ZIP will seek to raise a minimum of $4.0 million through the issue of 133,333,333
Shares (and a maximum of $6.0 million through the issue of 200,000,000 Shares) on
a post-Consolidation basis at an issue price of 3 cents per Share; and
(previously this was a minimum raise of $3.5 million and a maximum raise of $5.0
million at an issue price of 2 cents per Share)
3. in consideration for the Acquisition, ZIP will issue the following (all on a postConsolidation basis) amongst the current shareholders of DOU (“Vendors”):
i.
ii.
iii.

275,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares in ZIP (Consideration Shares);
75,000,000 performance shares (Performance Shares); and
75,000,000 unlisted options exercisable at 4 cents (DOU Options).

(previously this was 357,500,000 Consideration Shares, 357,500,000 Performance
Shares and nil DOU Options on a post consolidation basis).

To the extent that the ASX Listing Rules, or ASX, does not impose escrow on the
Consideration Shares, Performance Shares and DOU Options:
a) founder and management Vendors of DOU will agree to a voluntary 24month escrow period; and
b) DOU will procure that the balance of the Vendors agree to a voluntary 12month escrow period (this requirement may be waived by ZIP at its
discretion).

The Company has agreed to issue the DOU Options on the basis that this will provide it with
up to $3.0 million in additional funds (in 2 to 4 years time, depending on if and when the
Vendors exercise the DOU Options). The additional funds received from exercise of the
DOU Options will be used to supplement the Company’s activities.

Regulatory Approvals or Waivers
Subsequent to the new acquisition terms being agreed, ZIP sought and obtained from
ASX the following approvals and waivers:
Waiver decision - listing rule 2.1 condition 2
ASX Listing Rule 2.12 condition 2 requires that the issue or sale price of all securities
that an entity, at the time of its application for admission to the official list, seeks to
have quoted must be at least 20 cents. The requirement demonstrates that the
entity can raise funds at a price, or that its securities have a minimum value,
suitable for a listed entity. (20 cent rule). ASX has granted ZIP a waiver to the 20
cent rule on the basis that ZIP’s shares traded at a price below $0.02 in the 20
trading days prior to the suspension of its securities from quotation.

ZIP is proposing to undertake a consolidation of its securities at a 1.1:2 ratio to
achieve a market value for its securities of not less than 2 cents each.

For personal use only

The waiver to the 20 cent rule permits ZIP to undertake the Capital Raising at an
issue price less than $0.02 per share, provided the following conditions are met:
(a)

the issue price of the shares issue pursuant to the Capital Raising (Capital
Raising Shares) is not less than $0.02 per share;

(b)

the terms of this waiver are disclosed to the market and, along with the
terms and conditions of the Capital Raising Shares, are clearly disclosed in
the notice of meeting pursuant to which the Company will seek the
approval required under Listing Rule 11.1.2 for the Acquisition and in the
prospectus to be issued in respect of the Capital Raising;

(c)

ZIP’s shareholders approve the issue price of the Capital Raising Shares in
conjunction with the approval obtained under Listing Rule 11.1.2 in respect
of the Acquisition; and

(d)

ZIP completes a consolidation of its capital structure in conjunction with the
Acquisition such that its securities are consolidated at a ratio that will be
sufficient, based on the lowest price at which ZIP’s securities traded over
the 20 trading days preceding the date of the suspension of the ZIP’s
securities from official quotation, to achieve a market value for its securities
of not less than two cents each.

Waiver decision – Listing Rule 1.1 Condition 12
ASX Listing Rule 1.1 Condition 12 provides that for an entity to be admitted to the
official list of ASX, the exercise price for any options on issue in the entity must be
at least 20 cents in cash. ASX has granted ZIP a waiver to Listing Rule 1.1 Condition
12 on the basis that the proposed exercise price for the options to be granted to
the Lead Manager and Douugh as part of the Transaction is not less than 2 cents
each and the issue of the Options will be specifically approved by shareholders.
The Company’s proposed capital structure following the Acquisition will be
suitable for a listed entity.
The waiver of Listing Rule 1.1 Condition 12 permits the exercise price of the
Canaccord Options and the DOU Options (together, the “Waiver Options”) to not
be at least 20 cents and has been granted on the following conditions:
(a)

the exercise price of the Waiver Options is not less than $0.02 each;

(b)

the terms of this waiver are disclosed to the market and, along with the
terms and conditions of the Waiver Options, are clearly disclosed in the
notice of meeting pursuant to which ZIP will seek the approval required
under listing rule 11.1.2 for the Acquisition and in the prospectus to be
issued in respect of the Capital Raising; and

(c)

ZIP’s shareholders approve the exercise price of the Waiver Options in
conjunction with the approval obtained under listing rule 11.1.2 for the
Acquisition.

Confirmation Decision – Listing Rule 6.1
Listing Rule 6.1 provides that the terms of equity securities must be appropriate
and equitable in order to protect the interests of investors and the integrity of the
market.

ASX has confirmed that the terms of the Performance Shares to be issued by ZIP to
Douugh Vendors are appropriate and equitable on the basis that the milestones
attached to the Performance Shares fall within the parameters set out in
Guidance Note 19. The terms and structure of the Performance Shares comply
with sections 6 and 7 of Guidance Note 19.

For personal use only

Terms of the Performance Shares will be included in ZIP’s notice of meeting.
2.

Waiver Decision – Listing Rule 10.3.5
Listing Rule 10.3.5 provides that, in relation to shareholder approvals for the issue of
shares to related parties for the purpose of ASX Listing Rule 10.11, the securities are
to be issued no more than one month after the date of the meeting. The
underlying policy of ASX Listing Rule 10.13.5 is to provide certainty to security
holders and ensure that securities are issued before the approval is “stale” or
vitiated by a change in the entity’s circumstances. ASX has granted ZIP a waiver
from ASX Listing Rule 10.13.5 to permit the issue of the following shares to related
parties later than one month after the date of the general meeting of
Shareholders:
(a)

up to 3,850,000 fully paid ordinary shares to director Joshua Hunt;

(b)

up to 3,850,000 fully paid ordinary shares to director Umberto (Bert)
Mondello; and

(c)

up to 3,850,000 fully paid ordinary shares to director Salvatore Vallelonga.

Full terms of this waiver will be clearly disclosed in the Notice for the General
Meeting and in the prospectus to be issued in respect of the Capital Raising.

ZipTel is in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations under Listing Rule 3.1 and
the Board of ZIP will continue to provide shareholders with updates regarding the
Transaction in accordance with the Listing Rules. ASX takes no responsibility for the
contents of this announcement.
