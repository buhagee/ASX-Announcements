CPT ANNOUNCES PLACEMENT

Cipherpoint Limited (ASX:CPT) (the Company), Sydney, Australia Tuesday 7 July 2020 is pleased to
announce that, following the Company’s oversubscribed share purchase plan (SPP), in response to
interest received from other sophisticated investors seeking an opportunity to invest the Board
resolved to undertake, and has received binding commitments to, a placement of 19 million shares at
2.3c per share to raise an additional $437,000 (before costs).
The price of 2.3c per share is a discount of approximately 20% from the 15-day VWAP of 2.834c for the
15 days on which trades were recorded to 2 July 2020. It represents a premium of 1c (or a 77%
premium) to the SPP price.
The Board believes the placement will deliver value to existing shareholders (particularly those who
participated in the SPP) and will provide the Company with additional capital to allow it to accelerate
its cloud development and the integration of its products with the major collaboration platforms in the
market, including Microsoft Teams. The current pandemic has increased the focus on remote working,
collaboration and digital transformation and, in turn, the need for more vigilance around data access
and security.
The placement will be conducted under the Company’s existing placement capacity under ASX Listing
Rule 7.1 and ASX Listing Rule 7.1A. An Appendix 3B in relation to the proposed placement will be
released shortly.
This announcement has been authorised by the Board.
